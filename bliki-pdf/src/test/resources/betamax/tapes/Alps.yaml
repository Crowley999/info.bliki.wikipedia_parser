      The '''Alps''' are one of the great [[mountain range]] systems of [[Europe]] stretching approximately {{convert|1,200|km}} across eight [[Alpine countries]] from [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]] in the east, [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], and south east [[Germany]], to the west. [[Monaco]] and [[Italy]] to the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpconv.org/index_en &quot;Alpine Convention&quot;]. ''Alpine Conferences''. Retrieved August 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The mountains were formed over hundreds of millions of years as the African and Eurasian [[tectonic plate]]s collided. Extreme shortening &lt;!-- why shortening? --&gt; caused by the event resulted in marine [[sedimentary rock]]s rising by [[thrust fault|thrusting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] into high mountain peaks such as [[Mont Blanc]] and the [[Matterhorn]]. Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at {{convert|4810|m|abbr=on|0}} is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains many peaks higher than {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on|0}}, known as the &quot;[[List of Alpine four-thousanders|four-thousanders]]&quot;.

      The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones. Wildlife such as [[ibex]] live in the higher peaks to elevations of {{Convert|3400|m|abbr=on|0}}, and plants such as [[Edelweiss]] grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations. Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the [[Paleolithic]] era. A [[Ötzi the Iceman|mummified man]], determined to be 5,000 years old, was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian–Italian border in 1991. By the 6th century BC, the Celtic [[La Tène culture]] was well established. [[Hannibal]] famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants, and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had settlements in the region. In 1800 [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000. The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists, writers, and artists, in particular the [[Romanticism|Romantics]], followed by the [[golden age of alpinism]] as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks. In World War II, [[Adolf Hitler]] kept a [[Berghof (residence)|base of operation]] in the Bavarian Alps throughout the war.

      The Alpine region has a strong cultural identity.  The traditional culture of farming, cheesemaking, and woodworking still exists in Alpine villages, although the tourist industry began to grow early in the 20th century and expanded greatly after World War II to become the dominant industry by the end of the century. The [[Winter Olympic Games]] have been hosted in the Swiss, French, Italian, Austrian and German Alps. At present the region is home to 14 million people and has 120 million annual visitors.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chatré8&quot;&gt;Chatré, Baptiste, et al. (2010), 8&lt;/ref&gt;

      == Etymology ==
      [[File:Calanca Alp de Cascinarsa.jpg|thumb|left|An &quot;alp&quot; refers to a high mountain pasture where cows are brought to for grazing, often with a structure, such as this one on the south side of the Alps.]]
      The English word ''Alps'' derives from the Latin ''Alpes'' (through French). [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]], an ancient commentator of [[Virgil]], says in his commentary (''A.'' X 13) that all high mountains are called ''Alpes'' by Celts. The term may be common to [[Italo-Celtic]], because the [[Celtic languages]] have terms for high mountains derived from ''alp''.

      This may be consistent with the theory that in Latin ''Alpes'' is a name of non-Indo-European origin (which is common for prominent mountains and mountain ranges in the Mediterranean region). According to the Old English Dictionary, the Latin ''Alpes'' might possibly derive from a [[Pre-Indo-European languages|pre-Indo-European]] word *''alb'' &quot;hill&quot;, with ''Albania'' being a related derivation. Interestingly, Albania (which is a foreign name for modern Albanians) has been used as a name for a number of mountainous areas across Europe. In [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], ''Albania'' was a name for the eastern [[Caucasus]], while in the English language ''Albania'' (or ''Albany'') was occasionally used as a name for [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=Albania&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=1955-05-14 |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      It's likely that ''alb'' (&quot;white&quot;) and ''albus'' have common origins deriving from the association of the tops of tall mountains or steep hills with snow.

      In modern languages the term ''alp'', ''alm'', ''albe'' or ''alpe'' refers to a [[Transhumance in the Alps|grazing pastures]] in the alpine regions below the glaciers, not the peaks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid93&quot;&gt;Schmid et al. (2004), 93&lt;/ref&gt; An ''alp'' refers to a high mountain pasture where cows are taken to be grazed during the summer months and where hay barns can be found, and the term &quot;the Alps&quot;, referring to the mountains, is a misnomer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds43ff&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming 4&quot;&gt;Fleming (2000), 4&lt;/ref&gt; The term for the mountain peaks varies by nation and language: words such as ''horn'', ''kogel'', ''gipfel'', and ''berg'' are used in German speaking regions: ''mont'', ''pic'', ''dent'' and ''aiguille'' in French speaking regions; and ''monte'' or ''cima'' in Italian speaking regions.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 117–119&lt;/ref&gt;

      German ''Alpen'' is the accusative in origin, but was made the nominative in Modern German, whence also ''Alm''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissworld.org/en/switzerland/swiss_specials/swiss_mountains/names/ &quot;Names&quot;].

      == Geography ==
      {{main|Geography of the Alps}}
      [[File:Alps with borders.jpg|thumb|The Alps extend from France in the west to Slovenia in the east, and from Italy in the south to Germany in the north.]]

      The Alps are a crescent shaped geographic feature of central Europe that ranges in a {{convert|800|km|abbr=on|-1}} arc from east to west and is {{convert|200|km|abbr=on|-1}} in width. The mean height of the mountain peaks is {{convert|2.5|km|abbr=on|1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ceben 22–24&quot;/&gt; The range stretches from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] north above the [[Po (river)|Po river]] basin, extending through France from [[Grenoble]], eastward through mid and southern Switzerland. The range continues toward [[Vienna]] in Austria, and east to the [[Adriatic Sea]] and into [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Chatré9&quot;&gt;Chatré, Baptiste, et al. (2010), 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beattie  xii–xiii&quot;/&gt; To the south it dips into northern Italy and to the north extends to the south border of [[Bavaria]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beattie  xii–xiii&quot;&gt;Beattie (2006), xii–xiii&lt;/ref&gt; In areas like [[Chiasso]], Switzerland, and [[Neuschwanstein Castle|Neuschwanstein]], Bavaria, the demarkation between the mountain range and the flatlands are clear; in other places such as [[Geneva]], the demarkation is less clear. The countries with the greatest alpine territory are Switzerland, France, Austria and Italy.

      The highest portion of the range is divided by the glacial trough of the [[Rhone]] valley, with the [[Pennine Alps]] from [[Mont Blanc]] to the [[Matterhorn]] and [[Monte Rosa]] on the Southern side, and the [[Bernese Alps]] on the Northern. The peaks in the easterly portion of the range, in Austria and Slovenia, are smaller than those in the central and western portions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beattie  xii–xiii&quot; /&gt;

      The variances in nomenclature in the region spanned by the Alps makes classification of the mountains and subregions difficult, but a general classification is that of the [[Eastern Alps]] and [[Western Alps]] with the divide between the two occurring in eastern Switzerland according to geologist Stefan Schmid,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid93&quot; /&gt; near the [[Splügen Pass]].

      The highest peaks of the Western Alps and Eastern Alps, respectively, are Mont Blanc, at {{convert|4810|m|ft|abbr=on|-1}}&lt;ref&gt;Shoumtoff (2001), 23&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Piz Bernina]] at {{convert|4049|m|0}}. The second-highest peaks are [[Monte Rosa]] at {{convert|4634|m|abbr=on|-1}} and [[Ortler]]&lt;ref&gt;Excluding the [[Piz Zupò]] and [[Piz Roseg]] located in the Bernina range, close to Piz Bernina.&lt;/ref&gt; at {{convert|3905|m|abbr=on|-1}}, respectively

      Series of lower mountain ranges run parallel to the main chain of the Alps, including the [[French Prealps]] in France and the [[Jura Mountains]] in Switzerland and France. The secondary chain of the Alps follows the [[drainage divide|watershed]] from the Mediterranean Sea to the [[Vienna Woods|Wienerwald]], passing over many of the highest and most well-known peaks in the Alps. From the Colle di Cadibona to [[Col de Tende]] it runs westwards, before turning to the northwest and then, near the [[Colle della Maddalena]], to the north. Upon reaching the Swiss border, the line of the main chain heads approximately east-northeast, a heading it follows until its end near Vienna.&lt;!-- still uncited --&gt;

      == Passes ==
      [[File:Andermatt-Teufelsbruecke.jpg|thumb|''Teufelsbrücke'' (Devil's Bridge) at the [[Gotthard Pass]]; the medieval bridge is below the newer bridge.]]
      {{see also|Principal passes of the Alps}}

      The Alps have been crossed for war and commerce, and by pilgrims, students and tourists. Crossing routes by road, train or foot are known as ''passes'', and usually consist of depressions in the mountains in which a valley leads from the plains and hilly pre-mountainous zones. In the medieval period [[hospices]] were established by religious orders at the summits of many of the main passes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming 4&quot; /&gt; The most important  passes are the [[Col de l'Iseran]] (the highest), the [[Brenner Pass]], the [[Mont-Cenis]], the [[Great St. Bernard Pass]], the [[Col de Tende]], the [[Gotthard Pass]], the [[Semmering Pass]], and the [[Stelvio Pass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica''. ''Encyclopedia Online Academic Edition''. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 6 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      Crossing the Italian-Austrian border, the Brenner Pass separates the [[Ötztal Alps]] and [[Zillertal Alps]] and has been in use as a trading route since the 14th century. The lowest of the Alpine passes at {{convert|985|m|abbr=on|0}}, the Semmering crosses from [[Lower Austria]] to [[Styria]]; since the 12th century when a hospice was built there it has seen continuous use. A railroad with a tunnel {{convert|1|mi}} long was built along the route of the pass in the mid-19th century. With a summit of {{convert|2,469|m|abbr=on|0}}, the Great St. Bernard Pass is one of the highest in the Alps, crossing the Italian-Swiss border east of the Pennine Alps along the flanks of Mont Blanc. The pass was used by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] to cross 40,000 troops in 1800. The Saint Gotthard Pass crosses from [[Central Switzerland]] to [[Ticino]]; in the late 19th century the {{convert|9|mi}} long Saint Gotthard Tunnel was built connecting [[Lucerne]] in Switzerland,  with [[Milan]] in Italy. The [[Mont Cenis]] pass has been a major commercial road between Western Europe and Italy. Now the pass has been supplanted by the Fréjus Road and Rail tunnel. At {{convert|2,756|m|abbr=on|0}}, the Stelvio Pass in northern Italy is one of the highest of the Alpine passes; the road was built in the 1820s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt; The highest pass in the alps is the [[col de l'Iseran]] in [[Savoy]] (France) at {{convert|2,770|m|abbr=on|0}}.

      == Orogeny and geology ==
      {{main|Alpine orogeny|Geology of the Alps}}

      Important geological concepts were established as naturalists began studying the rock formations of the Alps in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century the now defunct theory of [[geosyncline]]s was used to explain the presence of &quot;folded&quot; mountain chains but by the mid-20th century the theory of [[plate tectonics]] became widely accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graciansky1ff&quot; /&gt;

      [[File:Nante d'arpanaz.jpg|thumb|The geologic [[Fold (geology)|folding]] seen at the Arpanaz waterfall, shown here in a mid-18th century drawing, was noted by 18th-century geologists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graciansky5&quot;&gt;Graciansky (2011), 5&lt;/ref&gt;]]

      The formation of the Alps (the [[Alpine orogeny]]) was an episodic process that began about 300 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 35&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Paleozoic]] Era the [[Pangaea]]n [[supercontinent]] consisted of a single [[tectonic plate]]; it broke into separate plates during the [[Mesozoic]] Era and the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]] sea developed between [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]] during the [[Jurassic]] Period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graciansky1ff&quot;&gt;Graciansky (2011), 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the [[Alpide belt]], from [[Gibraltar]] through the [[Himalayas]] to [[Indonesia]]—a process that began at the end of the [[Mesozoic]] and continues into the present. The formation of the Alps was a segment of this orogenic process,&lt;ref name=&quot;Graciansky1ff&quot; /&gt; caused by the collision between the [[African plate|African]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] plates&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerrard9&quot; /&gt; that began in the late [[Cretaceous]] Period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerrard16&quot;&gt;Gerrard, (1990), 16&lt;/ref&gt;

      Under extreme [[compressive stress]]es and pressure, marine [[sedimentary rock]]s were uplifted, creating characteristic recumbent [[Fold (geology)|folds]], or ''[[nappe]]s'', and [[thrust fault]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth'' (2008), 142&lt;/ref&gt;  As the rising peaks underwent erosion, a layer of marine [[flysch]] sediments was deposited in the [[foreland basin]], and the sediments became involved in younger nappes (folds) as the orogeny progressed. Coarse sediments from the continual uplift and erosion were later deposited in foreland areas as [[molasse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerrard9&quot;&gt;Gerrard, (1990), 9&lt;/ref&gt; The molasse regions in Switzerland and Bavaria were well-developed and saw further upthrusting of flysch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid102&quot;&gt;Schmid (2004), 102&lt;/ref&gt;
      [[File:MassifMontBlanc7438.JPG|thumb|left|The crystalline basement of the [[Mont Blanc Massif]].]]

      The Alpine orogeny occurred in ongoing cycles through to the Paleogene causing differences in nappe structures, with a late-stage orogeny causing the development of the [[Jura Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid97&quot;&gt;Schmid (2004), 97&lt;/ref&gt; A series of tectonic events in the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods caused different [[Palaeogeography|paleogeographic]] regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid97&quot;/&gt; The Alps are subdivided by different [[lithology]] (rock composition) and nappe structure according to the orogenic events that affected them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid93&quot;&gt;Schmid (2004), 93&lt;/ref&gt; The geological subdivision differentiates the Western, Eastern Alps and Southern Alps: the [[Helvetic nappes|Helveticum]] in the north, the [[Penninic nappes|Penninicum]] and [[Austroalpine nappes|Austroalpine system]] in the center and, south of the Periadriatic Seam, the [[Southern Alps (geology)|Southern Alpine system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid99&quot;/&gt;

      [[File:Matterhorn from Domhütte - 2.jpg|thumb|Compressed metamorphosed Tethyan sediments and their oceanic basement are sandwiched between the tip of the [[Matterhorn]], which consists of gneisses originally part of the African plate, and the base of the peak, which is part of the Eurasian plate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graciansky5&quot;/&gt;]]

      According to geologist Stefan Schmid, because the Western Alps underwent a metamorphic event in the [[Cenozoic]] Era while the Austroalpine peaks underwent an event in the Cretaceous Period, the two areas show distinct differences in nappe formations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid97&quot;/&gt; [[Flysch]] deposits in the Southern Alps of [[Lombardy]] probably occurred in the Cretaceous or later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid97&quot;/&gt;

      Peaks in France, Italy and Switzerland lie in the &quot;Houlliere zone&quot;, which consists of [[Basement (geology)|basement]] with sediments from the Mesozoic Era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid99&quot;&gt;Schmid, 99&lt;/ref&gt; High &quot;massifs&quot; with external sedimentary cover are more common in the Western Alps and were affected by [[Neogene]] Period [[Thin-skinned deformation|thin-skinned]] thrusting whereas the Eastern Alps have comparatively few high peaked massifs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid102&quot;/&gt; Similarly the peaks in Switzerland extending to western Austria (Helvetic nappes) consist of thin-skinned sedimentary folding that [[decollement|detached]] from former [[basement (geology)|basement]] rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid103&quot;&gt;Schmid (2004), 103&lt;/ref&gt;

      In simple terms the structure of the Alps consists of layers of rock of European, African and oceanic (Tethyan) origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graciansky29ff&quot;&gt;Graciansky (2011), 29&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom nappe structure is of continental European origin, above which are stacked marine sediment nappes, topped off by nappes derived from the African plate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graciansky31&quot;&gt;Graciansky (2011), 31&lt;/ref&gt; The Matterhorn is an example of the ongoing orogeny and shows evidence of great folding. The tip of the mountain consists of [[gneiss]]es from the African plate; the base of the peak, below the glaciated area, consists of European basement rock. The sequence of Tethyan marine sediments and their oceanic basement is sandwiched between rock derived from the African and European plates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graciansky5&quot;/&gt;

      The core regions of the Alpine orogenic belt have been folded and fractured in such a manner that erosion created the characteristic steep vertical peaks of the [[Swiss Alps]] that rise seemingly straight out of the foreland areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerrard16&quot;/&gt; Peaks such as Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, and high peaks in the Pennine Alps, the Briançonnais, and [[Hohe Tauern]] consist of layers of rock from the various orogenies including exposures of basement rock.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie (2006), 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

      &lt;!-- [[File:MassifMontBlanc7438.JPG|thumb|The cristalline basement of the [[Mont Blanc Massif]]]] --&gt;
      The [[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]] (UIAA) has defined a list of 82 &quot;official&quot; Alpine summits that reach at least {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 4000ers of the Alps: Official UIAA List|journal=UIAA-Bulletin|issue=145|date=March 1994|format=PDF|url=http://www.club4000.it/Articoli/Boll_uiaa.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100307064135/http://www.club4000.it/Articoli/Boll_uiaa.pdf|archivedate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list includes not only mountains, but also subpeaks with little [[Topographic prominence|prominence]] that are considered important [[mountaineering]] objectives. Below are listed the 22 &quot;four-thousanders&quot; with at least {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} of prominence.

      While Mont Blanc was first climbed in 1786, most of the Alpine four-thousanders were climbed during the first half of the 19th century; the ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 marked the end of the [[golden age of alpinism]]. [[Karl Blodig]] (1859–1956) was among the first to successfully climb all the major 4,000 m peaks. He completed his series of ascents in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Huxley, ''The Geographical magazine: Volume 59'', Geographical Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

      The first British Mont Blanc ascent was in 1788; the first female ascent in 1819. By the mid-1850s Swiss mountaineers had ascended most of the peaks and were eagerly sought as mountain guides. [[Edward Whymper]] reached the top of the Matterhorn in 1865 (after seven attempts), and in 1938 the last of the six [[great north faces of the Alps]] was climbed with the first ascent of the Eiger ''Nordwand'' (north face of the Eiger).&lt;ref name = &quot;Shoumatoff197ff&quot;&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 197–200&lt;/ref&gt;

      == Minerals ==
      The Alps are a source of a minerals that have been mined for thousands of years. In the 8th to 6th centuries BC during the [[Hallstatt culture]], Celtic tribes mined copper; later the Romans mined gold for coins in the [[Bad Gastein]] area. [[Erzberg]] in [[Styria]] furnishes high-quality iron ore for the steel industry. Crystals are found throughout much of the Alpine region such as [[cinnabar]], [[amethyst]], and [[quartz]]. The cinnabar deposits in Slovenia are a notable source of cinnabar pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 49–53&lt;/ref&gt;

      Alpine crystals have been studied and collected for hundreds of years, and began to be classified in the 18th century. [[Leonhard Euler]] studied the shapes of crystals, and by the 19th century crystal hunting was common in Alpine regions. David Friedrich Wiser amassed a collection of 8000 crystals that he studied and documented.  In the 20th century Robert Parker wrote a well-known work about the rock crystals of the Swiss Alps; at the same period a commission was established to control and standardize the naming of Alpine minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 10–17&lt;/ref&gt;

      == Glaciers ==
      {{see also|List of glaciers in Switzerland}}
      In the [[Miocene]] Epoch the mountains underwent severe erosion because of glaciation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerrard16&quot; /&gt; which was noted in the mid-19th century by naturalist [[Louis Agassiz]] who presented a paper proclaiming the Alps were covered in ice at various intervals—a theory he formed when studying rocks near his [[Neuchâtel]] home which he believed originated to the west in the Bernese Oberland. Because of his work he came to be known as the &quot;father of the ice-age concept&quot; although other naturalists before him put forth similar ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff63ff&quot;&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 63–68&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[File:Aletschgebiet aus dem Flugzeug.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis Agassiz]]'s studies of the [[Unteraar Glacier]] in the 1840s showed that it moved at {{convert|100|m|abbr=on|0}} per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff63ff&quot; /&gt;]]

      Agassiz studied glacier movement in the 1840s at the [[Unteraar Glacier]] where he found the glacier moved {{convert|100|m|abbr=on|0}} per year, more rapidly in the middle than at the edges. His work was continued by other scientists and now a permanent laboratory exists inside a glacier under the [[Jungfraujoch]], devoted exclusively to the study of Alpine glaciers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff63ff&quot; /&gt;

      Glaciers pick up rocks and sediment with them as they flow. This causes erosion and the formation of valleys over time. The [[Inn (river)|Inn]] valley is an example of a valley carved by glaciers during the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice ages]] with a typical terraced structure caused by erosion. Eroded rocks from the most recent ice age lie at the bottom of the valley while the top of the valley consists of erosion from earlier ice ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff63ff&quot; /&gt; Glacial valleys have characteristically steep walls (reliefs); valleys with lower reliefs and [[Scree|talus slopes]] are remnants of glacial troughs or previously infilled valleys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerrard132&quot;&gt;Gerrard, (1990), 132&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moraine]]s, piles of rock picked up during the movement of the glacier, accumulate at edges, center and the terminus of glaciers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff63ff&quot; /&gt;

      [[File:Jungfraujoch img 3699.jpg|thumb|Inside a glacier at the top of the train station at the [[Jungfraujoch]]]]

      Alpine glaciers can be straight rivers of ice, long sweeping rivers, spread in a fan-like shape (Piedmont glaciers), and curtains of ice that hang from vertical slopes of the mountain peaks. Some glaciers flow in two directions such as the glacier between the Jungfrau and the [[Mönch]] in Switzerland and the [[Similaun]] glacier on the border of Italy and Austria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff63ff&quot; /&gt;  The stress of the movement causes the ice to break and crack loudly, perhaps explaining why the mountains were believed to be home to dragons in the medieval period. The cracking creates unpredictable and dangerous [[crevasse]]s, often invisible under new snowfall, which cause the greatest danger to mountaineers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff71ff&quot;/&gt;

      Glaciers end in ice caves (the [[Rhone Glacier]]), by trailing into a lake or river, or by shedding snowmelt on a meadow. Sometimes a piece of glacier will detach or break resulting in flooding, property damage and loss of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff71ff&quot;&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century about 2500 people were killed by an avalanche in a village on the French-Italian border; in the 19th century 120 homes in a village near Zermatt were destroyed by an avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

      High levels of precipitation cause the glaciers to descend to [[permafrost]] levels in some areas whereas in other, more arid regions, glaciers remain above about the {{convert|3,500|m|abbr=on|0}} level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerrard78&quot;&gt;Gerrard, (1990), 78&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|1817|km2}} of the Alps covered by glaciers in 1876 had shrunk to {{convert|1342|km2|abbr=on}} by 1973, resulting in decreased river run-off levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerrard108&quot;&gt;Gerrard, (1990), 108&lt;/ref&gt; Forty percent of the glaciation in Austria has disappeared since 1850, and 30% of that in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Ceben (1998), 38&lt;/ref&gt;

      == Rivers and lakes ==
      [[File:St.Bartholomä.jpg|thumb|left|The [[St. Bartholomew's Church, Berchtesgaden|St. Bartholomew's chapel]] on the [[Königssee]] in Bavaria is a popular tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 31&lt;/ref&gt;]]

      The Alps provide lowland Europe with drinking water, irrigation, and hydroelectric power.&lt;ref&gt;Chatré, Baptiste, et al. (2010), 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the area is only about 11 percent of the surface area of Europe, the Alps provide up to 90 percent of water to lowland Europe, particularly to arid areas and during the summer months. Cities such as Milan depend on 80 percent of water from Alpine runoff.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chatré9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benniston et al. 2011, 1&quot;&gt;Benniston et al. (2011), 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price, Martin. ''Mountains: Globally Important Eco-systems&quot;. University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; Water from the rivers is used in over 500 [[hydroelectricity]] power plants, generating as much as 2900 kilowatts per hour of electricity.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chatré8&quot;/&gt;

      Major European rivers flow from Switzerland, such as the [[Rhine]], the [[Rhone]], the [[Inn (river)|Inn]], the [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]] and the [[Po (river)|Po]] rivers, all of which have headwaters in the Alps and flow into neighbouring countries, finally emptying into the [[North Sea]], the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea and the [[Black Sea]]. Other rivers such as the [[Danube]] have major tributaries flowing into them that originate in the Alps.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chatré9&quot;/&gt; The Rhone river is second to the [[Nile]] as a freshwater source to the Mediterranean Sea; the river begins as glacial meltwater, flows into [[Lake Geneva]], and from there to France where one of its uses is to cool nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benniston et al. 2011, 3&quot;&gt;Benniston et al. (2011), 3&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhine originates in a 30 square kilometre area in Switzerland and represents almost 60 percent of water exported from the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benniston et al. 2011, 3&quot;/&gt;  Tributary valleys, some of which are complicated, channel water to the main valleys which can experience flooding during the snow melt season when rapid runoff causes debris torrents and swollen rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ceben 1998, 31&quot;&gt;Ceben (1998), 31&lt;/ref&gt;

      The rivers form lakes, such as Lake Geneva, a crescent shaped lake crossing the Swiss border with  Geneva on the Swiss side and the town of [[Evian-les-Bains]] on the French side. In Germany, the medieval [[St. Bartholomew's Church, Berchtesgaden|St. Bartholomew's chapel]] was built on the south side of the [[Königssee]], accessible only by boat or by climbing over the abutting peaks.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 24, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

      Scientists have been studying the impact of climate change and water use. For example, each year more water is diverted from rivers for [[snowmaking]] in the ski resorts, the effect of which is yet unknown. Furthermore, the decrease of glaciated areas combined with a succession of winters with lower-than-expected precipitation may have a future impact on the rivers in the Alps as well as an effect on the water availability to the lowlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benniston et al. 2011, 1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chatré, Baptiste, et al. (2010), 13&lt;/ref&gt;

      == Climate ==
      {{main|Climate of the Alps|High Alps}}

      The Alps are a classic example of what happens when a [[Temperateness|temperate]] area at lower altitude gives way to higher-elevation terrain. Elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the [[polar region]]s have been called [[Alpine climate|Alpine]]. A rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease (see [[adiabatic lapse rate]]). The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of heat, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain.&lt;!-- this really needs a cite --&gt; The height of the Alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and a dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 3&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[File:Aletschgletscher mit Pinus cembra1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Aletsch Glacier]] with pine trees growing on the hillside]]

      The severe weather in the Alps has been studied since the 18th century; particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal [[foehn wind]]. Numerous weather stations were placed in the mountains early in the early 20th century, providing continuous data for climatologists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ceben 22–24&quot;&gt;Ceben (1998), 22–24&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the valleys are quite arid such as the [[Aosta]] valley in Italy, the [[Maurienne]] in France, the [[Valais]] in Switzerland, and northern [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ceben 22–24&quot; /&gt;

      The areas that are not arid and receive high precipitation experience periodic flooding from rapid snowmelt and runoff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ceben 1998, 31&quot;/&gt;  The mean precipitation in the Alps ranges from a low of {{convert|2600|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year to {{convert|3600|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year, with the higher levels occurring at high altitudes. At altitudes between {{convert|1,000|m|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|3,000|m|abbr=on|0}}, snowfall begins in November and accumulates through to April or May when the melt begins. [[Snow line]]s vary from {{convert|2,400|m|abbr=on|0}} to {{convert|3,000|m|abbr=on|0}}, above which the snow is permanent and the temperatures hover around the freezing point even July and August. High-water levels in streams and rivers peak in June and July when the snow is still melting at the higher altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Ceben (1998), 34–36&lt;/ref&gt;

      The Alps are split into five climatic zones, each with different vegetation. The climate, plant life and animal life vary among the different sections or zones of the mountains. The lowest zone is the colline zone, which exists between {{convert|500|m|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on|0}}, depending on the location. The [[montane]] zone extends from {{convert|800|m|abbr=on|0}} to {{convert|1,700|m|abbr=on|0}}, followed by the sub-Alpine zone from {{convert|1,600|m|abbr=on|0}} to {{convert|2,400|m|abbr=on|0}}. The Alpine zone, extending from [[tree line]] to snow line, is followed by the glacial zone, which covers the glaciated areas of the mountain. Climatic conditions show variances within the same zones; for example, weather conditions at the head of a mountain  valley, extending directly from the peaks, are colder and more severe than those at the mouth of a valley which tend to be less severe and receive less snowfall.&lt;ref&gt;Viazzo (1980), 17&lt;/ref&gt;

      Various models of [[climate change]] have been projected into the 22nd century for the Alps, with an expectation that a trend toward increased temperatures will have an effect on snowfall, snowpack, glaciation, and river runoff.&lt;ref&gt;Benniston (2011), 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

      == Ecology ==

      === Flora ===
      {{main|Flora of the Alps}}

      [[File:Gentiana clusii03.jpg|thumb|Stemless gentian (''[[Gentiana acaulis]]'')]]

      13,000 species of plants have been identified in the Alpine regions.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chatré8&quot;/&gt; Alpine plants are grouped by habitat and soil type which can be [[limestone]] or non-calcerous. The habitats range from meadows, bogs, woodland (deciduous and coniferous) areas to soilless scree and [[moraine]]s, and rock faces and ridges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds43ff&quot;&gt;Reynolds, (2012), 43–45&lt;/ref&gt; A natural vegetation limit with altitude is given by the presence of the chief [[deciduous]] trees—oak, beech, [[Ash tree|ash]] and [[sycamore maple]].  These do not reach exactly to the same elevation, nor are they often found growing together; but their upper limit corresponds accurately enough to the change from a temperate to a colder climate that is further proved by a change in the presence of wild herbaceous vegetation.  This limit usually lies about {{convert|1200|m|abbr=on|-1}} above the sea on the north side of the Alps, but on the southern slopes it often rises to {{convert|1500|m|abbr=on|-1}}, sometimes even to {{convert|1700|m|abbr=on|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 75&lt;/ref&gt;

      Above the forestry, there is often a band of short pine trees (''[[Pinus mugo]]''), which is in turn superseded by ''Alpenrosen'', dwarf shrubs, typically ''[[Rhododendron ferrugineum]]'' (on acid soils) or ''[[Rhododendron hirsutum]]'' (on alkaline soils).&lt;ref&gt;Beattie (2006), 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the Alpenrose prefers acidic soil, the plants are found throughout the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds43ff&quot; /&gt; Above the [[tree line]] is the area defined as &quot;alpine&quot; where in the [[alpine meadow]] plants are found that have adapted well to harsh conditions of cold temperatures, aridity, and [[high-altitude adaptation|high altitudes]]. The alpine area fluctuates greatly because of regional fluctuations in tree lines.&lt;ref&gt;Körner (2003), 9&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[File:Leontopodium alpinum1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Edelweiss (''[[Edelweiss|Leontopodium alpinum]]'')]]

      Alpine plants such the [[Gentiana acaulis|Alpine gentian]] grow in abundance in areas such as the meadows above the [[Lauterbrunnental]]. Gentians are named after the [[Illyria]]n king [[Gentius]], and 40 species of the early-spring blooming flower grow in the Alps, in a range of {{convert|1,500|m|abbr=on|0}} to {{convert|2,400|m|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 85&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the gentians in Switzerland [[D. H. Lawrence]] described them as &quot;darkening the day-time, torch-like with the smoking blueness of Pluto's gloom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;qtd in Beattie (2006), 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Gentians tend to &quot;appear&quot; repeatedly as the spring blooming takes place at progressively later dates, moving from the lower altitude to the higher altitude meadows where the snow melts much later than in the valleys. On the highest rocky ledges the spring flowers bloom in the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds43ff&quot; /&gt;

      At these higher altitudes, the plants tend to form isolated cushions. In the Alps, several species of flowering plants have been recorded above {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on|-1}}, including ''[[Ranunculus glacialis]]'', ''[[Androsace alpina]]'' and ''Saxifraga biflora''. The ''[[Eritrichium nanum]]'', commonly known as the King of the Alps, is the most elusive of the alpine flowers, growing on rocky ridges at {{convert|2,600|m|abbr=on|0}} to {{convert|3,750|m|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 87&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best known of the alpine plants is the [[Edelweiss]] which grows in rocky areas and can be found at altitudes as low as {{convert|1,400|m|abbr=on|0}} and as high as {{convert|3,400|m|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds43ff&quot; /&gt; The plants that grow at the highest altitudes have adapted to conditions by specialization such as growing in rock screes that give protection from winds.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sharp14ff&quot;&gt;Sharp (2002), 14&lt;/ref&gt;

      The extreme and stressful climatic conditions give way to the growth of plant species with [[secondary metabolites]] important for medicinal purposes. Origanum vulgare, Prunella vulgaris, Solanum nigrum and [[Urtica dioica]] are some of the more useful medicinal species found in the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;Kala, C.P. and Ratajc, P. 2012.[http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-012-0246-x &quot;High altitude biodiversity of the Alps and the Himalayas: ethnobotany, plant distribution and conservation perspective&quot;.] ''Biodiversity and Conservation'', 21 (4): 1115–1126.&lt;/ref&gt;

      Human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas, and, except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps, forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the 17th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrard (1990), 225&lt;/ref&gt; The vegetation has changed since the second half of the 20th century, as the high alpine meadows cease to be harvested for hay or used for grazing which eventually might result in a regrowth of forest. In some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life cannot recover during the non-skiing months, whereas areas that still practice a natural ''piste'' type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sharp14ff&quot;/&gt;

      === Fauna ===
      The Alps are a habitat for 30,000 species of wildlife, ranging from the tiniest [[snow flea]]s to [[brown bear]]s, many of which have made adaptations to the harsh cold conditions and high altitudes to the point that some only survive in specific micro-climates either directly above or below the [[snow line]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Chatré8&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 90, 96, 101&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[File:Jeune bouquetin de face.jpg|thumb|upright|Young Alpine ibex. When fully grown its horns will be about one metre wide.]]

      The largest mammal to live in the highest altitudes are the [[Ibex]], which have been sighted as high as {{convert|3,000|m|abbr=on|0}}. The ibex live in caves and descend to eat the succulent alpine grasses.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 104&lt;/ref&gt; Classified as [[antelopes]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds43ff&quot; /&gt; [[Chamois]] are smaller than ibex and found throughout the Alps, living above the tree line and are common in the entire alpine range.&lt;ref&gt;Rupicapra rupicapra [Linnaeus, 1758][http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Rupicapra_rupicapra.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of the eastern Alps are still home to brown bears. In Switzerland the canton of [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] was named for the bears but the last bear is recorded as having been killed in 1792 above [[Kleine Scheidegg]] by three hunters from [[Grindelwald]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 101&lt;/ref&gt;

      Many rodents such as [[voles]] live underground. [[Marmots]] live almost exclusively above the tree line as high as {{convert|2,700|m|abbr=on|0}}. They hibernate in large groups to provide warmth,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff102ff&quot;&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; and can be found in all areas of the Alps, in large colonies they build beneath the alpine pastures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds43ff&quot; /&gt; [[Golden eagle]]s and [[Bearded Vulture]]s are the largest birds to be found in the Alps; they nest high on rocky ledges and can be found at altitudes of {{convert|2,400|m|abbr=on|0}}. The most common bird isa the [[alpine chough]] which can be found scavenging at climber's huts or at the [[Jungfraujoch]], a high altitude tourist destination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff97ff&quot;&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[File:Parnassius phoebus.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Alpine Apollo Butterfly]] has adapted to Alpine conditions.]]

      Reptiles such as [[Viperidae|adders]] and [[Viperidae|vipers]] live up to the snow line; because they cannot bear the cold temperatures they hibernate underground and soak up the warmth on rocky ledges.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shoumatoff95ff&quot;&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 96&lt;/ref&gt;  The high-altitude [[Alpine salamander]]s have adapted to living above the snow line by giving birth to fully developed young rather than laying eggs.  [[Brown trout]] can be found in the streams up to the snow line.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shoumatoff95ff&quot;/&gt; Molluscs such as the [[Helicigona|wood snail]] live up the snow line. Popularly gathered as food, the [[snail]]s are now protected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff88ff&quot;&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

      A number of species of [[moth]]s live in the Alps, some of which are believed to have evolved in the same habitat up to 120&amp;nbsp;million years ago, long before the Alps were created. [[Small Blue|Blue moth]]s can commonly be seen drinking from the snow melt; some species of blue moths fly as high as {{convert|1,800|m|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 93&lt;/ref&gt; The butterflies tend to be large, such as those from the swallowtail [[Parnassus]] family, with a habitat that ranges to {{convert|1,800|m|abbr=on|0}}. Twelve species of beetles have habitats up to the snow line; the most beautiful and formerly collected for its colours but now protected is the ''[[Rosalia alpina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 91&lt;/ref&gt; Spiders, such as the large [[wolf spider]], live above the snow line and can be seen as high as {{convert|4,00|m|abbr=on|0}}. [[Scorpion]]s can be found in the Italian Alps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff88ff&quot; /&gt;

      Some of the species of moths and insects show evidence of having been indigenous to the area from as long ago as the Alpine orogeny. In [[Lac d'Emosson|Emosson]]
      in Valais, Switzerland, dinosaur tracks were found in 1970s, dating probably from the [[Triassic]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2012), 75&lt;/ref&gt;

      == History ==
      {{main|History of the Alps}}

      === Prehistory to Christianity ===
      [[File:Clothes of Ötzi, Naturhistorisches Museum Wien.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ötzi]], the 5,300-year-old mummy, found in the [[Ötztal Alps]] shown here in a museum reproduction of what he may have looked like.]]

      About 10,000 years ago, when the ice melted after the [[last glacial period]], late [[Paleolithic]] communities were established along the lake shores and in cave systems. Evidence of human habitation has been found in caves near [[Vercors Cave System|Vercors]], close to Grenoble; in Austria the [[Mondsee (lake)|Mondsee]] culture shows evidence of houses built on piles to keep them dry. Standing stones have been found in Alpine areas of France and Italy. The [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica]] are more than 5000 years old; more than 200,000 drawings and etchings have been identified at the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beattie25ff&quot;&gt;Beatttie, (2006), 25&lt;/ref&gt;

      In 1991 a mummy of a [[neolithic]] body, known as [[Ötzi the Iceman]], was discovered by hikers on the [[Similaun]] glacier. His clothing and gear indicate that he lived in an alpine farming community, while  the location and manner of his death—an arrowhead was discovered in his shoulder—suggests he was traveling from one place to another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beattie21ff&quot;&gt;Beatttie, (2006), 21&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the [[Mitochondrial DNA]] of Ötzi, has shown that he belongs to the K1 [[subclade]] which cannot be categorized into any of the three modern branches of that subclade. The new subclade has provisionally been named ''K1ö'' for ''Ötzi''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2808%2901254-2 Luca Ermini et al., &quot;Complete Mitochondrial Genome Sequence of the Tyrolean Iceman,&quot; ''Current Biology'', vol. 18, no. 21 (30 October 2008), pp. 1687–1693].&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[Celt]]ic tribes settled in Switzerland between 1000 to 1500 BC. The [[Raetia]]ns lived in the eastern regions, while the west was occupied by the [[Helvetii]] and the [[Allobroges|Allobrogi]] settled in the Rhone valley and in [[Savoy]]. Among the many substances Celtic tribes mined was salt in areas such as [[Salzburg]] in Austria where evidence of the [[Hallstatt culture]] was found by a mine manager in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beattie25ff&quot; /&gt; By the 6th century BC the [[La Tène culture]] was well established in the region,&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 2&lt;/ref&gt; and became known for high quality [[Celtic art#Halstatt gallery|decorated weapons and jewelry]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 131&lt;/ref&gt; The Celts were the most widespread of the mountain tribes—they had warriors that were strong, tall and fair skinned skilled with iron weapons, which gave them an advantage in warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 110&lt;/ref&gt;

      During the [[Second Punic War]] in 218 BC, the [[Carthaginian]] general [[Hannibal]] probably [[Hannibal crossing the Alps|crossed the Alps]] with an army numbering 38,000 infantry, 8,000 cavalry, and 37 war elephants. This was one of the most celebrated achievements of any military force in ancient warfare,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancel&quot;&gt;Lancel, Serge, (1999), 71&lt;/ref&gt; although no evidence exists of the actual crossing or the place of crossing. The Romans, however, had built roads along the mountain passes, which continued to be used through the medieval period to cross the mountains and Roman road markers can still be found on the mountain passes.&lt;ref&gt;Prevas (2001), 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[File:Chillon - Dents du Midi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Château de Chillon]], an early medieval castle on the north shore of [[Lake Geneva]], is shown here against the backdrop of the [[Dents du Midi]]]]

      The Roman expansion brought the defeat of the Allobrogi in 121 BC and during the [[Gallic Wars]] in 58 BC [[Julius Caesar]] overcame the Helvetii. The Rhaetians continued to resist but were eventually conquered when the Romans turned northward to the [[Danube]] valley in Austria and defeated the [[Brigantes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Beattie27ff&quot;&gt;Beatttie, (2006), 27&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans built settlements in the Alps; towns such as [[Aosta]] (named for Augustus) in Italy, [[Martigny]] and [[Lausanne]] in Switzerland, and [[Partenkirchen]] in Bavaria show remains of Roman baths, villas, arenas and temples.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 28–31&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Alpine region was gradually settled by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], ([[Lombards]], [[Alemanni]], [[Bavarii]], and [[Franks]]) from the 6th to the 13th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 31, 34&lt;/ref&gt; with the latest expansion corresponding to the [[Walser]] migrations.

      === Christianity, feudalism, and Napoleonic wars ===
      Christianity was established in the region by the Romans, and saw the establishment of monasteries and churches in the high regions. The Frankish expansion of the [[Carolingian Empire]] and the Bavarian expansion in the eastern Alps introduced feudalism and the building of castles to support the growing number of dukedoms and kingdoms. Castello del Buonconsiglio in [[Trento]], Italy, still has intricate frescoes, excellent examples of Gothic art, in a tower room. In Switzerland, [[Château de Chillon]] is preserved as an example of medieval architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 32, 34, 37, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

      Much of the medieval period was a time of power struggles between competing dynasties such as the [[House of Savoy]], the [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] in northern Italy and the [[House of Habsburg]] in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 41, 46, 48&lt;/ref&gt; In 1291 to protect themselves from incursions by the Habsburgs, four [[cantons]] in the middle of Switzerland drew up a [[Federal Charter of 1291|charter]] that is considered to be a declaration of independence from neighboring kingdoms. After a series of battles fought in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, more cantons joined the confederacy and by the 16th century Switzerland was well-established as a separate state.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 56, 66&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[File:PopovAN 001.jpg|thumb|Russian troops under [[Suvorov]] crossing the Alps in 1799]]
      During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the late 18th century and early 19th century, [[Napoleon]] annexed territory formerly controlled by the Habsburgs and Savoys. In 1798 he established the Helvetic Republic in Switzerland; two years later he led an army across the St. Bernhard pass and conquered almost all of the Alpine regions.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

      In the 19th century, the monasteries built in the high Alps during the medieval period to shelter travelers and as places of pilgrimage, became tourist destinations. The [[Benedictine]]s had built monasteries in [[Lucerne]], Switzerland, and [[Oberammergau]]; the [[Cistercian]]s in the Tyrol and at [[Lake Constance]]; and the [[Augustinian]]s had abbeys in the [[Savoy]] and one in the center of [[Interlaken]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great St Bernard Hospice]], built in the 9th or 10th centuries, at the summit of the [[Great Saint Bernard Pass]] was shelter for travelers and place for pilgrims since its inception; by the 19th century it became a tourist attraction with notable visitors such as author [[Charles Dickens]] and mountaineer Edward Whymper.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 73, 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

      === Exploration ===
      {{main|Exploration of the High Alps}}

      [[File:Matterhorn ascent Dore.jpg|thumb|upright|''The [[first ascent of the Matterhorn]]'' (1865), lithograph by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

      [[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon]] dated charcoal placed around 50,000 years ago was found in the ''Drachloch'' (Dragon's Hole) cave above the village of Vattis in the canton of [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]], proving that the high peaks were visited by prehistoric people. Seven bear skulls from the cave may have been buried by the same prehistoric people.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 108&lt;/ref&gt; The peaks, however, were mostly ignored except for a few notable examples, and long left to the exclusive attention of the people of the adjoining valleys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff188ff&quot;&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 188–191&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain peaks were seen as terrifying, the abode of dragons and demons, to the point that people blindfolded themselves to cross the Alpine passes.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 6&lt;/ref&gt; The glaciers remained a mystery and many still believed the highest areas to be inhabited by dragons.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 12&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[Charles VII of France]] ordered his [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] to climb [[Mont Aiguille]] in 1356. The knight reached the summit of [[Rocciamelone]] where he left a bronze triptych of three crosses, a feat which he conducted with the use of ladders to traverse the ice.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The first recorded ascent of a peak was by [[Petrarch]] who in 1336 climbed [[Mont Ventoux]] in France. --&gt; In 1492 Antoine de Ville climbed Mont Aiguille, without reaching the summit, an experience he described as &quot;horrifying and terrifying.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumatoff188ff&quot; /&gt; [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was fascinated by variations of light in the higher altitudes, and climbed a mountain—scholars are uncertain which one; some believe it may have been [[Monte Rosa]]. From his description of a &quot;blue like that of a gentian&quot; sky it is thought that he reached a significantly high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;qtd in Shoumatoff (2001), 193&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century four [[Chamonix]] man almost made the summit of Mont Blanc but were overcome by altitude sickness and snowblindness.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 192–194&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[Conrad Gessner]] was the first naturalist to ascend the mountains in the 16th century, to study them, writing that in the mountains he found the &quot;theatre of the Lord&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 8&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century more naturalists began to arrive to explore, study and conquer the high peaks; they were followed by artists, writers and painters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming vii&quot;&gt;Fleming (2000), vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]] (1740–1799) in the Pennine Alps,&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 27&lt;/ref&gt; and the  Benedictine monk of [[Disentis]] [[Placidus a Spescha]] (1752–1833).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming vii&quot; /&gt; Born in Geneva, Saussure was enamored with the mountains from an early age; he left a law career to become a naturalist and spent many years trekking through the Bernese Oberland, the Savoy, the Piedmont and Valais, studying the glaciers and the geology, as he became an early proponent of the theory of rock upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 12–13, 30, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure, in 1787, was a member of the third ascent of Mont Blanc—today the summits of all the peaks have been climbed.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shoumatoff197ff&quot;/&gt;

      === The Romantics  ===
      &lt;!-- [[File:Caspar David Friedrich 032.jpg|left|thumb|Caspar David Friedrich]] --&gt;
      [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] of Geneva was the first of many to present the Alps as a place of allure and beauty, banishing the prevalent conception of the mountains as a hellish wasteland inhabited by demons. Rousseau's conception of alpine purity was later emphasized with the publication of [[Albrecht von Haller]]'s poem ''Die Alpen'' that described the mountains as an area of mythical purity.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 121–123&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the 18th century the first wave of [[Romanticism|Romantics]] such as  [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] came to admire the scenery; [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] visited the area in 1790, writing of his experiences in ''[[The Prelude]]''. Schiller later wrote the play ''[[William Tell (play)|William Tell]]'' romanticising Swiss independence. After the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the Alpine countries began to see an influx of poets, artists, and musicians,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming 2000, 83&quot;&gt;Fleming (2000), 83&lt;/ref&gt; as visitors came to experience the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] effects of monumental nature.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[Image:Bourget lac panoramic-3 2007-08-17.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Panoramic view from [[Nivolet]] peak. The Bourget lake inspired many romantic poets and especially Lamartine]]
      The scenery of the [[lac du Bourget]] in Savoy inspired the romantic poet [[Lamartine]] who wrote '''Le Lac''' (the lake)

      In 1816 [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and his wife [[Mary Shelley]] visited Geneva and all three were inspired by the scenery in their writings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming 2000, 83&quot;/&gt; During these visits Shelley wrote the poem &quot;[[Mont Blanc (poem)|Mont Blanc]]&quot;, Byron wrote &quot;[[The Prisoner of Chillon]]&quot; and the dramatic poem ''[[Manfred]]'', and Mary Shelley, who found the scenery overwhelming, conceived the idea for the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' in her villa on the shores of Lake Geneva in the midst of a thunderstorm. When [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] travelled to [[Chamonix]], he declaimed, in defiance of Shelley, who had signed himself &quot;Atheos&quot; in the guestbook of the Hotel de Londres near Montenvers,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Hartman, [http://litthe.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/1/4.full &quot;Gods, Ghosts, and Shelley's 'Atheos'&quot;], ''Literature and Theology'', Volume 24, Issue 1, pp. 4–18&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Who would be, who could be an atheist in this valley of wonders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 127–133&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century scientists began to arrive en masse to study the geology and ecology of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 139&lt;/ref&gt;

      === The World Wars ===
      During [[World War I]], an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 soldiers died as a result of avalanches during the mountain campaign in the Alps at the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Austrian-Italian]] front, many of which were caused by [[artillery]] fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Davis| first = Lee| title = Natural Disasters, New Edition| url = http://books.google.com/?id=CRzMOYIuLJEC&amp;pg=PA7| year = 2009| publisher = Infobase Publishing| isbn = 978-1-4381-1878-9| page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Rabofsky et al., Lawininenhandbuch, Innsbruck, Verlaganstalt Tyrolia, 1986, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Some 10,000 men, from both sides, lost their lives in avalanches in December 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soldiers-perish-in-avalanche-as-world-war-i-rages History Channel - December 13, 1916: Soldiers perish in avalanche as World War I rages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- maybe move to avalanches section? will make ref formatting consistent --&gt;

      Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler]] had a lifelong romantic fascination with the Alps and by the 1930s established a home in the [[Obersalzberg]] region outside of [[Berchtesgaden]]. His first visit to the area was in 1923 and he maintained a strong tie there until the end of his life. At the end of World War II the US Army occupied Obersalzberg, to prevent Hitler from retreating with the [[Wehrmacht]] into the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (2007), 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[File:Ghent altarpiece at Altaussee.jpg|thumb|The Nazis hid looted art in salt mines at [[Altaussee]], such as the [[Early Netherlandish art|Early Netherlandish]] ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' which sustained significant damage.]]

      By 1940 the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] had occupied many of the Alpine countries. Austria underwent a political coup that made it part of the Third Reich; France had been invaded and Italy was a [[fascist]] regime. Switzerland was the only country to luckily avoid invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Halbrook (1998), 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss Confederate mobilized its troops—the country follows the doctrine of &quot;armed neutrality&quot; with all males required to have military training—a number that [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] estimated to be about 850,000. The Swiss commanders wired the infrastructure leading into the country, and threatening to destroy bridges, railway tunnels and passes in the event of a Nazi invasion, and then they retreated to the heart of the mountain peaks where conditions were harsher and a military invasion would involve difficult and protracted battles.&lt;ref&gt;Halbrook (2006), 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

      [[Ski troops]] were trained for the war, and battles were waged in mountainous areas such as the battle at Riva Ridge in Italy, where the American [[10th Mountain Division]] encountered heavy resistance in February 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Feuer (2006), viii&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, a substantial amount of [[Nazi plunder]] was found stored in Austria, where Hitler had hoped to retreat as the war drew to a close. The [[salt mines]] surrounding the [[Altaussee]] area, where American troops found 75 kilos of gold coins stored in a single mine, were used to store looted art, jewels, and currency; vast quantities of looted art were found and returned to the owners.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (2007), 10, 151&lt;/ref&gt;

      == Alpine people and culture ==
      {{further|Transhumance in the Alps|Swiss folklore}}
      The population of the region is 14 million spread across eight countries.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chatré8&quot;/&gt; On the rim of the mountains, on the plateaus and the plains the economy consists of manufacturing and service jobs whereas in the higher altitudes and in the mountains farming is still essential to the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Chartes et. el. (2010), 14&lt;/ref&gt;
      [[File:Hallstatt 300.jpg|thumb|[[Hallstatt]] is known for its production of salt, dating back to prehistoric times.]]

      Much of the Alpine culture is unchanged since the medieval period when skills that guaranteed survival in the mountain valleys and in the highest villages became mainstays, leading to strong traditions of carpentry, woodcarving, baking and pastry-making, and cheesemaking.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shoumatoff123ff&quot;&gt;Shoumataff (2001), 123–126&lt;/ref&gt; Farming and forestry continue to be mainstays of Alpine culture, industries that provide for export to the cities and maintain the mountain ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Chartes et. el. (2010), 5&lt;/ref&gt;

      Farming had been a traditional occupation for centuries, although is becoming less dominant in the 20th century with the advent of tourism. Grazing and pasture land is limited because of the steep and rocky topography of the Alps. In mid-June cows are moved to the highest pastures close to the snowline, where they are watched by herdsmen who stay in the high altitudes often living in stone huts or wooden barns during the summers.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shoumatoff123ff&quot;/&gt; Villagers celebrate the day the cows are herded up to the pastures and again when they return in mid-September. The ''Alpanschluss'' or ''Désalpes'' (&quot;coming down from the alps&quot;) is celebrated by decorating the cows with garlands and enormous [[cowbell]]s while the farmers dress in traditional costumes.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shoumatoff123ff&quot;/&gt;

      [[File:Schaufschod 2009 05.JPG|thumb|left|Herding sheep]]

      Cheesemaking is an ancient tradition in most Alpine countries. A wheel of cheese from the [[Emmental]] in Switzerland can weigh up to 100 pounds, and the [[Beaufort cheese|Beaufort]] in [[Savoy]] can weight up to 70&amp;nbsp;kg (154 pounds). Owners of the cows traditionally receive from the cheesemakers a portion in relation to the proportion of the cow's milk from the summer months in the high alps. Haymaking is an important farming activity in mountain villages which has become somewhat mechanized recent years, although the slopes are so steep that usually scythes are necessary to cut the grass. Hay is normally brought in twice a year, often also on festival days.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shoumatoff123ff&quot;/&gt; Alpine festivals vary from country to country and often include the display of local costumes such as [[dirndl]] and [[tracht]]en, the playing of [[Alpenhorn]]s, wrestling matches, some pagan traditions such as [[Walpurgis Night]], and in many areas [[Carnival]] is celebrated before [[Lent]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoumataff (2001), 129, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

      In the high villages people live in homes built according to medieval designs that withstand cold winters. The kitchen is separated from the living area (called the ''stube'', the area of the home heated by a stove), and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat. The typical Swiss [[chalet]] originated in the Bernese Oberland. Chalets often face south or downhill,  are built of solid wood, with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily. Stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside, and balconies are sometimes enclosed.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shoumatoff123ff&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoumataff (2001), 134&lt;/ref&gt;
      In some French chalets called &quot;Tournavel&quot; the cows are staying downstairs, people using the warmth from the cattle to heat up the living areas designed for humans upstairs.

      Food is passed from the kitchen to the stube, where the dining room table is placed. Some meals are communal, such as [[fondue]], where a pot is set in the middle of the table for each person to dip into. Other meals are still served in a traditional manner on carved wooden plates. Furniture has been traditionally elaborately carved and in many Alpine countries carpentry skills are passed from generation to generation. Roofs are constructed from Alpine rocks such as pieces of [[schist]], gneiss or [[slate]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoumataff (2001), 131, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Theses chalets are usually found in the higher parts of the valleys were the wood is rare and the amount of snow very important during the cold months. The inclination of the roof cannot exceed 40%, allowing the snow to stay on top. Thus this thick layer is used as an effective insulation from the cold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cauesavoie.org/wp-content/uploads/Fascicule-haute-maurienne.pdf Cahier d'architecture Haute Maurienne/Vanoise]&lt;/ref&gt;

      The Alpine regions are multicultural and linguistically diverse. Dialects are common, and vary from valley to valley, region to region. In the Slavic Alps alone 19 dialects have been identified. Some of the French dialects spoken in the French, Swiss and the Italian alps of [[Aosta Valley]] derive from [[Occitan language|Old Provençal]] and is called mostly [[Arpitan]]; the German dialects derive from Germanic tribal languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumataff 2001, 114–166&quot;&gt;Shoumataff (2001), 114–166&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romansh language|Romansh]], spoken by two percent of the population in southeast Switzerland, is an ancient Rheato-Romanic language derived from Latin, remnants of ancient Celtic languages and perhaps [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoumataff 2001, 114–166&quot;/&gt;
      In others parts of the alps, Celtic languages were used. Like the name of [[Tarentaise valley|Tarentaise]] in [[Savoy]] (France) deriving from &quot;Darantasia&quot; a Celtic word, meaning &quot;The wild waters&quot; (see [[Ceutrones]]).

      The tourism industry began in the early 19th century when foreigners visited the Alps, traveled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery, and stayed at the spa-resorts. Large hotels were built during the [[Belle Époque]]; [[Rack railway|cog-railways]], built early in the 20th century, brought tourists to ever higher elevations, with the [[Jungfraubahn]] terminating at the Jungfraujoch after going through a tunnel in Eiger. During this period winter sports were slowly introduced: in 1882 the first [[figure skating]] championship was held in [[St. Moritz]], and downhill skiing became a popular sport with English visitors early in the 20th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bart&quot; /&gt; as the first ski-lift was installed in 1908 above Grindelwald.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie (2006), 198&lt;/ref&gt;

      During the post-World War I period ski-lifts were built in Swiss and Austrian towns to accommodate winter visitors, but summer tourism continued to be important; by the mid-20th century the popularity of downhill skiing increased greatly as it became more accessible and in the 1970s several new villages were built in France devoted almost exclusively to skiing, such as [[Les Menuires]]. Until this point Austria and Switzerland had been the traditional and more popular destinations for winter sports, but by the end of the 20th century and into the early 21st century, France, Italy and the Tyrol began to see increases in winter visitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bart&quot; /&gt; From 1980 to the present, ski-lifts have been modernized and snow-making machines installed at many resorts, leading to concerns regarding the loss of traditional Alpine culture and questions regarding sustainable development as the winter ski industry continues to develop quickly and the number of summer tourists decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bart&quot; /&gt;

      The region is serviced by {{convert|4,200|km|abbr=on}} of roads used by 6 million vehicles.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chatré8&quot;/&gt; Train travel is well established in the Alps, with, for instance {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}} of track for every {{convert|1000|km2|abbr=on}} in a country such as Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissworld.org/en/economy/transport/rail/ &quot;Rail&quot;.] Swissworld.org. Retrieved August 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Most of [[List of highest railways in Europe|Europe's highest railways]] are located there. Moreover, plans are underway to build a {{convert|57|km|abbr=on}}-long [[Gotthard Base Tunnel|sub-alpine tunnel]] connecting the older [[Lötschberg Tunnel|Lötschberg]] and [[Gotthard Tunnel|Gotthard]] tunnels built in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissworld.org/en/switzerland/resources/story_switzerland/the_longest_hole/ &quot;The Longest Hole&quot;]. Swissworld.org. Retrieved August 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      Some high mountain villages, such as [[Avoriaz]] (in France), [[Wengen]], and [[Zermatt]] (in Switzerland) are accessible only by [[Aerial lift|cable car]] or cog-rail trains, and are car free. Other villages in the Alps are considering becoming car free zones or limiting the number of cars for reasons of sustainability of the fragile Alpine terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (2000), 107&lt;/ref&gt;

      The lower regions and larger towns of the Alps are well-served by motorways and main roads, but higher mountain passes and byroads can be treacherous even in summer due to steep slopes. Many passes are closed in winter. A multitude of airports around the Alps (and some within), as well as long-distance rail links from all neighbouring countries, afford large numbers of travellers easy access from abroad.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chatré8&quot;/&gt;
