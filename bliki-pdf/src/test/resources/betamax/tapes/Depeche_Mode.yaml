      \ music|electronic]] band formed in 1980 in [[Basildon]], Essex. The group's original line-up consisted of [[Dave Gahan]] (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005), [[Martin Gore]] (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981), [[Andy\
      \ Fletcher (musician)|Andy Fletcher]] (keyboards), and [[Vince Clarke]] (keyboards, chief songwriter 1980-81). Depeche Mode released their debut record in 1981, ''[[Speak &amp; Spell (album)|Speak &amp; Spell]]'', bringing the band onto the English new\
      \ wave scene. Clarke left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record ''[[A Broken Frame]]'', released the following year. [[Alan Wilder]] (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band afterward,\
      \ replacing Clarke, while Gore took over lead songwriting duties, establishing a line up that would continue for the next thirteen years.\n\nThe band's last albums of the 1980s; ''[[Black Celebration]]'' and ''[[Music for the Masses]]'' established them\
      \ as a dominant force on the mainstream electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In the new decade, Depeche Mode released ''[[Violator (album)|Violator]]'',\
      \ catapulting them to massive mainstream success. The subsequent album, ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'' and the supporting [[Devotional Tour]] exacerbated tensions within the band to the point where Alan Wilder quit in 1995, leading to intense media\
      \ and fan speculation that the band would split. Now a trio once again, the band released ''[[Ultra (Depeche Mode album)|Ultra]]'' in 1997, recorded at the height of Gahan's near-fatal drug abuse, Gore's alcoholism and Fletcher's depression. The release\
      \ of ''[[Exciter (album)|Exciter]]'' confirmed Depeche Mode's willingness to remain together, the subsequent, and very successful, [[Exciter Tour]] being their first tour in support of an original album in eight years since the [[Devotional Tour]] although\
      \ the band had [[The Singles Tour|toured in 1998]] to support ''[[The Singles 86–98|The Singles 86&gt;98]]'' compilation album.\n\nDepeche Mode have had 50 songs in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and thirteen top 10 albums in the UK charts, two of which debuted\

      \ years as a synthpop band and were considered teen idols. Following the departure of [[Vince Clarke]], their music began to take on a darker tone as Martin Gore assumed lead songwriting duties. Gore's lyrical artistry has been recognised as encapsulating\
      \ themes such as sex, religion, and politics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/23/showbiz/music/martin-gore-depeche-mode/ |title=Catching up with Depeche Mode - CNN.com |publisher=CNN |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; so\
      \ much so that many labeled the band's lyrical and musical themes as dark and bleak. In response, Gore stated he feels lyrical themes which tackle issues related to solitude and loneliness present more of a realistic character and are a better representation\
      \ of reality, whereas he finds 'happy songs' fake and unrealistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I27PyhhqGV4 |title=Martin Gore (Depeche Mode) interview |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-02-22 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;\
