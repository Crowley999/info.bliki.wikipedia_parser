      \ published by [[DC Comics]]. It is the second installment of [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Batman in film#Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher series (1989-1997)|initial ''Batman'' film series]], with [[Michael Keaton]] reprising the title role of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The\
      \ film introduces the characters of [[Max Schreck#Cultural references|Max Shreck]] ([[Christopher Walken]]), a business tycoon who teams up with the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] ([[Danny DeVito]]) to take over [[Gotham City]], as well as the character\
      \ of [[Catwoman]] ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]).\n\nBurton originally did not want to direct another Batman film because of his mixed emotions toward the [[Batman (1989 film)|previous film]] in 1989. [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]] delivered a\
      \ script that satisfied Burton; [[Wesley Strick]] did an uncredited rewrite, removing the characters of [[Harvey Dent]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and rewriting the [[climax (narrative)|climax]]. Before Pfeiffer's casting, [[Demi Moore]] and [[Nicole\
      \ Kidman]] were each offered the role of Catwoman, but both of them turned it down. Filming of ''Batman Returns'' started in [[Burbank, California]] in June 1991.\n\n''Batman Returns'' was released on June 19, 1992 to financial and critical success, though\
      \ it caused some controversy for being darker than its predecessor. The film's budget was an estimated $80 million, while it made $45,687,710 in the United States during its opening weekend (June 19–21, 1992), grossing $282,800,000 worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb.com&quot;&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103776/&lt;/ref&gt;\
      \ The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]], as well as winning the [[Saturn Award for Best Makeup]]. It was also nominated for\
      \ a Saturn Award in the categories of [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film|Best Fantasy Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Burton, [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for DeVito and [[Saturn Award\

      \ however, and is found by a flock of [[penguin]]s. Thirty-three years later, the child, Oswald Cobblepot ([[Danny DeVito]]), resurfaces as a criminal, the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], who kidnaps millionaire industrialist Max Shreck ([[Christopher Walken]]).\
      \ With evidence of his corporate crimes, Cobblepot blackmails Shreck into helping him leave the sewers to become part of Gotham's elite. The Penguin arranges for the Mayor's child to be kidnapped, whom he then &quot;rescues&quot; in order to set himself\
      \ up as a public hero. Despite the Penguin's popularity, however, socialite Bruce Wayne ([[Michael Keaton]]) remains skeptical of the Penguin's image, and while investigating the Penguin's past, he comes across evidence that appears to suggest that the\
      \ Penguin was once a freak show performer with the disgraced Red Triangle Circus Gang, who have recently been wreaking havoc on Gotham and whose previous performances resulted in the disappearance of several children. As [[Batman]], Bruce does his best\
      \ to defend Gotham from the gang.\n\nMeanwhile, Shreck surprises his secretary Selina Kyle ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), in the course of her preparation for his meeting with Bruce regarding Shreck's proposed [[power plant]]. While innocently pulling relevant\
      \ documents, Selina accesses Shreck's protected files, uncovering compromising information, revealing that the plant will drain Gotham's power supply. Realizing Selina knows too much, Shreck pushes her out of a window, leaving her for dead on the ground\
      \ many stories below. Selina survives the fall after being revived by alley cats. She returns to her apartment, then suffers a [[psychotic break]] and reinvents herself as [[Catwoman]], a catsuit-clad burglar dedicated to getting revenge on her boss. Shreck\
      \ then hatches a plan to [[recall election|recall]] Gotham City's current mayor ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]) and elect the Penguin in his place, in order to cement his control over the city and complete his power plant project. The Red Triangle\
      \ Gang cause chaos around Gotham to create bad press for the Mayor.\n\nMeanwhile, Bruce and Selina meet in person and begin a romantic relationship, a situation complicated by Catwoman's teaming with the Penguin in an effort to rid Gotham of Batman. They\
      \ kidnap the Ice Princess ([[Cristi Conaway]]), a woman chosen to turn on the Gotham Christmas Tree lights, and frame Batman for the crime. Finding the Princess balancing precariously on the ledge of a high building, Batman tries to save her, but to no\
      \ avail; the Penguin unleashes an umbrella full of bats which frighten the Princess into plunging to her death, and frames Batman for killing her. When Catwoman rejects his advances, the Penguin tries, unsuccessfully, to kill her. When Batman returns to\
      \ the [[Batmobile]], he finds that the Penguin has sabotaged it; as the Penguin takes the [[Batmobile]] on a remote-controlled rampage through Gotham, he gloats about fooling the entire city. Batman ultimately escapes the Penguin's trap, however.\n\nWhen\
      \ Bruce exposes the Penguin's plans to dupe Gotham, thereby ruining his election chances, the Penguin initiates a plan to murder all of Gotham's first-born sons by kidnapping and taking them into his lair to drown them in a pool of water that has been\
      \ contaminated with Shreck's toxic waste. He personally attempts to take Max's son, Charles &quot;Chip&quot; Shreck ([[Andrew Bryniarski]]), but agrees to take Max instead after Max begs him. Batman foils the Penguin's scheme, whereupon the Penguin then\
      \ decides to launch missiles around Gotham using mind-controlled penguins. However, Batman is able to jam the frequency used to control the penguins and has missiles launched at the Penguin's base. Batman confronts the Penguin, which culminates in the\
      \ Penguin falling into the toxic waters in his lair. Batman tries to persuade Catwoman to turn Shreck over to the police, even unmasking himself in the process, but Shreck draws a gun. Catwoman claims that she still has six of her [[Cat#History and mythology|nine\
      \ lives]] left, and remains standing after Shreck shoots her four times. Catwoman uses a [[taser]] to cause an explosion, electrocuting Shreck and apparently sacrificing herself (using up her &quot;eighth life&quot;). The Penguin then emerges from the\
      \ toxic water and tries to kill Batman, but fails and he succumbs to his wounds. His penguins then take his body into the sewer waters as a final resting place.\n\nLater, Bruce is being driven around the city at night with butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]]\
      \ ([[Michael Gough]]) and sees what looks like Catwoman's shadow on a wall. Alfred stops the car, and Bruce finds Selina's cat Miss Kitty, which he takes with him and leaves. As the [[Bat-Signal]] lights up the night sky, Catwoman rises up into the foreground,\

      \ They spent $250,000 storing the sets from the first film. [[Tim Burton]] had mixed emotions about directing another film in the franchise after his experiences with the previous film. &quot;I will return if the sequel offers something new and exciting&quot;,\
