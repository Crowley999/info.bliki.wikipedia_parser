      '''Metallica''' is an American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding &quot;big four&quot; of [[thrash metal]] alongside [[Slayer]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. Metallica was formed in 1981 when [[James Hetfield]] responded to an advertisement that drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] had posted in a local newspaper. The current line-up features founders Hetfield (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Ulrich (drums), longtime lead guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] and bassist [[Robert Trujillo]], who joined the band in 2003. Previous members of the band are lead guitarist [[Dave Mustaine]], who went on to found Megadeth, bassists [[Ron McGovney]] (demos only), [[Cliff Burton]] (the first three records, died in 1986), and [[Jason Newsted]]. The band also had a long collaboration with producer [[Bob Rock]], who produced all of its albums from 1990 to 2003 and served as a temporary bassist between the departure of Newsted and the hiring of Trujillo.

      The band earned a growing fan-base in the [[underground music]] community and critical acclaim with its first four albums, with their third, ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' (1986), described as one of the most influential and &quot;heavy&quot; thrash metal albums. Metallica achieved substantial commercial success with their [[Metallica (album)|eponymous fifth album]] (also known as ''The Black Album''), which debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. With this release the band expanded its musical direction resulting in an album that appealed to a more [[mainstream]] audience.

      In 2000, Metallica was among a number of artists who filed a [[Metallica v. Napster, Inc.|lawsuit]] against [[Napster]] for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without any band member's consent. A settlement was reached, and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, the release of ''[[St. Anger]]'' (2003) alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the &quot;steel-sounding&quot; [[snare drum]]. A film titled ''[[Some Kind of Monster (film)|Some Kind of Monster]]'' documented the recording process of ''St. Anger'' and the tensions within the band during that time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

      Metallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 25 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won nine [[Grammy Awards]], and has had five consecutive albums debut at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, making Metallica the first band to do so. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the [[Nielsen SoundScan|SoundScan]] Era. Metallica ranks as one of [[List of best-selling music artists|the most commercially successful bands of all time]], having sold over 110 million records worldwide. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. As of December 2012, Metallica is the fourth best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 53,642,000 albums in the United States alone.

      In 2012, Metallica formed the [[independent music|independent]] [[record label]] Blackened Recordings, and took ownership of all of their albums and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metallica Launch New Record Label|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/metallica-launch-new-record-label-20121130|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=November 30, 2012|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      ==History==

      ===Early years (1981–1983)===
      [[File:Metallica wordmark.svg|thumb|The classic Metallica logo, used on their early releases. It was also used on their ninth studio album ''[[Death Magnetic]]'' (2008) and on ''[[Guitar Hero: Metallica]]'', albeit in a slightly more slanting form.]]
      Metallica was formed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in late 1981 when the [[Denmark|Danish]]-born drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper—''[[The Recycler]]''—which read &quot;Drummer looking for other metal musicians to [[Jam (music)|jam]] with [[Tygers of Pan Tang]], [[Diamond Head (band)|Diamond Head]] and [[Iron Maiden]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline Early 1981 - Early 1982&quot;/&gt; Guitarists [[James Hetfield]] and Hugh Tanner of [[Leather Charm]] answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked [[Metal Blade Records]] founder [[Brian Slagel]] if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album ''[[Metal Massacre]]''. Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline Early 1981 - Early 1982&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Metallica Timeline Early 1981 – Early 1982 |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=1 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5h73iF8Ol |work=MTV |archivedate=May 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band was officially formed in October 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metallica.com/timeline.asp?page=events&amp;n_categoryid=1988&amp;year=1981?sPosx=41 |title=1981: Events |work=Timeline |publisher=Metallica |accessdate=December 26, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090623031847/http://www.metallica.com/timeline.asp?page=events&amp;n_categoryid=1988&amp;year=1981?sPosx=41 |archivedate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      Ulrich talked to his friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine. Quintana had proposed the names MetalMania and Metallica. Ulrich used Metallica for the name of his band. A second advertisement was placed in ''The Recycler'' for a position as lead guitarist. [[Dave Mustaine]] answered, and after seeing his expensive guitar equipment, Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song &quot;Hit the Lights&quot; for the ''Metal Massacre I'' compilation. Hetfield played bass on the song and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline Early 1981 - Early 1982&quot;/&gt; Released on June 14, 1982, early pressings of ''Metal Massacre I'' listed the band incorrectly as &quot;Mettallica&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Legends&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Music Legends| url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/lloyd-grant-interview-metallica/| title=Lloyd Grant Interview| accessdate=6 May 2013|date=4 January 2012|last=Saulnier|first=Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although angered by the error, Metallica managed to create enough &quot;[[Word of mouth|buzz]]&quot; with the song and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982 at Radio City in [[Anaheim, California]], with newly recruited bassist [[Ron McGovney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline March 14, 1982 – July 6, 1982&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Metallica Timeline March&amp;nbsp;14, 1982 – July 6, 1982 |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=2 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5h747w4yB |work=MTV |archivedate=May 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metallica recorded its first demo, ''[[Power Metal (Metallica album)|Power Metal]]'', a name inspired by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982. The term &quot;[[thrash metal]]&quot; was first referred to by ''[[Kerrang!]]''{{'s}} journalist [[Malcolm Dome]] while making a reference to the [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]'s song &quot;[[Metal Thrashing Mad]]&quot; in ''Kerrang!''{{'s}} issue 62, page 8, published on February 23, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dome | first = Malcolm | title = [[Kerrang!]] | chapter = Anthrax 'Fistful of Metal' | volume = 62 | publisher = Spotlight Publications Ltd. | date = February 23, 1984 | location = London, UK | page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      Prior to this, [[James Hetfield]] referred to their sound as &quot;[[power metal]]&quot;. In the fall of 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub [[Whisky a Go Go]] which featured bassist [[Cliff Burton]] in a band called [[Trauma (band)|Trauma]]. The two were &quot;blown away&quot; by Burton's use of a [[wah-wah pedal]] and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney out as they thought that he &quot;didn't contribute anything, he just followed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline Fall 1982 - April 16, 1983&quot;/&gt; Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year he accepted on the condition the band move to [[El Cerrito, California|El Cerrito]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the ''Megaforce'' demo (1983).&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline Fall 1982 - April 16, 1983&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Metallica Timeline Fall 1982 – April&amp;nbsp;16, 1983 |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=3 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hBuBZnaR |work=MTV |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      Metallica was ready to record its debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the cost, the band began looking for other options. Concert promoter [[Johny Zazula|Johny &quot;Z&quot; Zazula]], who had heard the demo ''No Life 'til Leather'' (1982), offered to broker a record deal with Metallica and New York City-based record labels. After receiving no interest from various record labels, Zazula borrowed the money to cover the record's recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, [[Megaforce Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pillsbury 2006 2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pillsbury|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      ===''Kill 'Em All'' and ''Ride the Lightning'' (1983–1984)===
      In May 1983, Metallica traveled to [[Rochester, New York]], to record its debut album, ''Metal Up Your Ass'', with production duties handled by Paul Curcio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Christe|2003|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Band members decided to kick Mustaine out of the band for drug and [[alcohol abuse]] and violent behavior just prior to the sessions on April 11, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cecolini |first=Vinny |date=November 1998 |title=Foreclosure of a Team |journal=Metal Hammer |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] flew in to replace Mustaine the same afternoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pillsbury 2006 2&quot;/&gt;

      Mustaine, who went on to found [[Megadeth]], has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews. He said Hammett &quot;stole my job.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dave Mustaine: James Hetfield Is Jealous of Me&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Dave Mustaine: James Hetfield Is Jealous of Me |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=27141 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hBun2sKu |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=September 21, 2004 |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mustaine was &quot;pissed off&quot; because he believes Hammett became popular by playing the guitar leads that Mustaine wrote.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dave Mustaine Back in Buisness&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=AskMen.com Editors |title=Interview: Dave Mustaine news |url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_100/149b_dave_mustaine_interview.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hBvB86jd |work=AskMen.com |publisher=IGN Entertainment |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1985 interview with ''[[Metal Forces]]'', Mustaine slammed Hammett saying, &quot;it's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that ''No Life 'til Leather'' tape and got voted No.&amp;nbsp;1 guitarist in your magazine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Forces&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Love it to Death – Bernard Doe speaks to Dave Mustaine about life after Metallica |last=Doe |first=Bernard |publisher=[[Metal Forces]] |url=http://www.metalforcesmagazine.com/site/feature-megadeth-mf12/ |accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Megadeth's debut album ''[[Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!]]'' (1985), Mustaine included the song &quot;Mechanix&quot;, which Metallica reworked and retitled &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot; on ''Kill 'Em All''. Mustaine said he did this to &quot;straighten Metallica up&quot;, as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Forces&quot;/&gt; Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983 at the nightclub The Showplace in [[Dover, New Jersey]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline Fall 1982 - April 16, 1983&quot;/&gt; with Anthrax's original line-up, including [[Dan Lilker]] and [[Neil Turbin]], as direct support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metallipromo.com/an.html |title=Anthrax; |publisher=Metallipromo.com |date=December 24, 2010 |accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time the two bands performed live together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline Fall 1982 - April 16, 1983&quot;/&gt;

      The band's debut studio album was initially going to be titled ''Metal Up Your Ass''. Because of conflicts with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album with that name, it was renamed ''[[Kill 'Em All]]''. Released on Megaforce Records in the United States and [[Music for Nations]] in Europe, the album peaked at number 120 on the ''Billboard'' 200 in 1986,&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica Chart Positions&quot;/&gt; and although the album was not initially a financial success, some songs like &quot;Whiplash&quot;, &quot;Seek &amp; Destroy&quot;, &quot;Hit The Lights&quot; and &quot;The Four Horseman&quot; earned Metallica a growing fan base in the [[Underground music|underground]] metal scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lepage|first=Mark|date=October 31, 2009|url=http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/story.html?id=9a47a506-f3a6-44e2-9fd3-443a42042b63|title=Metal metamorphosis|newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|publisher=James Orban|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band embarked on the [[Kill 'Em All for One]] tour with [[Raven (band)|Raven]] to support the release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline May 10–27, 1983 - July 27 – Sep 3, 1983&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Metallica Timeline May&amp;nbsp;10–27, 1983 – July 27 – Sept 3, 1983 |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=4 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hA8pmpfV |work=MTV |archivedate=May 30, 2009 |accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1984, Metallica supported [[Venom (band)|Venom]] on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, where the band performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in [[Zwolle]], Netherlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline October–December 1983 - August 1984&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Metallica Timeline October–December 1983 – August 1984 |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=5 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hA91rPYW |work=MTV |archivedate=May 30, 2009 |accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      Metallica recorded its second studio album, ''[[Ride the Lightning]]'', at Sweet Silence Studios in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark. Released in August 1984, the album reached number 100 on the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica Chart Positions&quot;/&gt; A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items.

      ===''Master of Puppets'' (1984–1986)===
      [[Elektra Records]] [[A&amp;R]] director Michael Alago, and co-founder of Q-Prime Management Cliff Burnstein, attended a September 1984 Metallica concert. Impressed with what they saw, they signed Metallica to Elektra Records and made the band a client of Q-Prime Management.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline Fall, 1984 - March 27, 1986&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Metallica Timeline Fall, 1984 – March&amp;nbsp;27, 1986 |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=6 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hEnas3Pr |work=MTV |archivedate=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metallica's burgeoning success was such that the band's British label Music for Nations released a limited edition &quot;Creeping Death&quot; single, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the United States. Two of the three songs on the record ([[cover version]]s of [[Diamond Head (band)|Diamond Head]]'s &quot;[[Am I Evil?]]&quot;, and [[Blitzkrieg (band)|Blitzkrieg]]'s &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;) appeared on the 1989 Elektra reissue of ''Kill 'Em All''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Christe|2003|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with [[Tank (band)|Tank]] to an average crowd of 1,300.

Metallica played its largest show at the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival on August 17, 1985, with [[Bon Jovi]] and [[Ratt]] at [[Donington Park#Music festivals|Donington Park]] in England, playing in front of 70,000 people.

      On September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica's [[Damage, Inc. Tour]], members drew cards to determine the bunks of the tour bus in which they would sleep. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. Around dawn near [[Dörarp]], [[Sweden]], the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to flip several times. Ulrich, Hammett, and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, bassist Burton was pinned under the bus and did not survive. Hetfield recalls, &quot;I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, 'Don't fucking do that!' I already wanted to kill the [bus driver]. I don't know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn't alive anymore.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline June 26, 1986 – September 27, 1986&quot;&gt;{{cite web

      Roughly 40 people tried out for auditions including Hammett's childhood friend, [[Les Claypool]] of [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Troy Gregory]] of [[Prong (band)|Prong]], and [[Jason Newsted]], formerly of [[Flotsam and Jetsam (band)|Flotsam and Jetsam]]. Newsted learned Metallica's entire setlist, and after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided that Newsted was the one to replace Burton, and Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in [[Reseda, California]]. The members took it on themselves to &quot;initiate&quot; Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of [[wasabi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline October 1986 - March 1987&quot;/&gt;

      After Newsted joined Metallica, the band left its El Cerrito practice space (dubbed ''&quot;the Metalli-mansion&quot;'', a suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer [[Mark Whitaker (music producer)|Mark Whitaker]]) and relocated to the adjacent cities of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      Metallica finished its tour in the early months of 1987. In March 1987, Hetfield broke his wrist a second time skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' appearance. In August 1987, an all-covers [[extended play]] titled ''[[The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited]]'' was released. The extended play was recorded in an effort to utilize the band's newly constructed recording studio, test out the talents of Newsted, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled ''[[Cliff 'Em All]]'' was released in 1987 commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica. Footage included [[bass solo]]s, home videos, and pictures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline August 21, 1987 – December 4, 1987&quot;&gt;{{cite web

      Following the release of ''...And Justice for All'', Metallica released its debut music video for the song &quot;[[One (Metallica song)|One]]&quot;. The band performed the song in an abandoned warehouse, and footage was [[remix]]ed with the film ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|Johnny Got His Gun]]''. Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV, with the alternate performance-only version held back in the event that MTV banned the remix version. MTV accepted the remix version, and the video was viewers' first exposure to Metallica.

      On August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining [[Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour]], Hetfield suffered second and [[third degree burns]] to his arms, face, hands, and legs. There was confusion with the new [[pyrotechnics]] setup, which resulted in Hetfield walking into a {{convert|12|ft|m|sing=on}} flame during &quot;Fade to Black&quot;.

      After almost three years of touring to support ''Metallica'', including a headlining performance at [[Woodstock '94]], Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played three outdoor shows which included headlining [[Donington Park]] in the United Kingdom, supported by [[Slayer]], [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]], [[Slash's Snakepit]], [[Therapy?]], and [[Corrosion of Conformity]]. The short tour was titled Escape from the Studio '95. The band spent roughly one year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of ''[[Load (album)|Load]]'' in 1996, which debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 and [[ARIA Charts]], marking the band's second number one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica Chart Positions&quot;/&gt; The cover of ''Load'' was created by [[Andres Serrano]], and was called ''Blood and Semen III''.

Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival [[Lollapalooza]] in the summer of 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Playboy Interview - Metallica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Load review&quot;/&gt;

      During early production of the album, the band had produced enough material for a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released, and the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in the follow-up album, ''[[Reload (Metallica album)|Reload]]''. The cover was created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline December 1995 - June 27, 1996&quot;/&gt; ''Reload'' debuted number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica Chart Positions&quot;/&gt; Hetfield noted in the 2004 documentary film ''[[Some Kind of Monster (film)|Some Kind of Monster]]'' that some of the songs on these albums were initially thought by the band to be of average quality, and were &quot;polished and reworked&quot; until judged to be releasable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Some Kind of Monster film&quot;/&gt; To promote ''Reload'', Metallica performed on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in December 1997, performing &quot;[[Fuel (song)|Fuel]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Memory Remains]]&quot; with [[Marianne Faithfull]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica timeline November 18, 1997 – December 8, 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite web

      On April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the [[San Francisco Symphony]] orchestra conducted by [[Michael Kamen]]. Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on &quot;[[Nothing Else Matters]]&quot;, approached the band in 1991 with the idea of pairing Metallica's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event, &quot;[[No Leaf Clover]]&quot; and &quot;[[S&amp;M (Metallica album)|-Human]]&quot;. The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film ''[[S&amp;M (Metallica album)|S&amp;M]]''. It entered the ''Billboard'' 200 at number two, and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica Chart Positions&quot;/&gt;

      ===Napster controversy (2000)===
      In 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song &quot;[[I Disappear]]&quot;, which was supposed to be released in combination with the [[Mission: Impossible II (soundtrack)|''Mission: Impossible II'' soundtrack]], was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the [[Napster]] [[peer-to-peer]] file-sharing network, and also found that the band's entire catalogue was freely available.&lt;ref name=&quot;Testimony of Mr. Lars Ulrich&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV&quot;&gt;MTV Video Music Awards 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Ulrich was booed on stage later at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, [[Blink-182]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2000/12/40795?currentPage=all |title=Funny as a Lars Attack |work=Wired.om}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nyrock.com/features/2000/vma00.asp |title=MTV's Video Music Awards 2000: If only I have a brain |publisher=NY Rock |date=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=115952&amp;page=1 |title=Eminem and 'N Sync Big VMA Winners |publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      As plans were being made to enter the recording studio, Newsted left the band on January 17, 2001.

      In April 2001, filmmakers [[Joe Berlinger]] and [[Bruce Sinofsky]] began following Metallica to document the recording process of the next studio album.

      In 2006, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer [[Bob Rock]] would not be producing Metallica's next studio album.

This prompted the band's United Kingdom distributor, [[Vertigo Records]], to officially release the album two days ahead of schedule, on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking any legal action against the retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich made such responses to the [[Internet leak|leak]] as, &quot;...We're ten days from release.

Early Metallica releases contained fast [[tempo]]s, [[harmony|harmonized]] leads, and nine-minute [[instrumental]]s.

Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the [[grunge]] movement of the early 1990s. In ''Load'', an album that has been described as &quot;an almost [[alternative rock]]&quot; approach, the band focused on non-metal influences and changed musical direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metallica - ReLoad&quot;/&gt; Moving away from lyrical themes dealing with drugs and monsters, Metallica's new lyrical approach focused on anger, loss, and retribution.
