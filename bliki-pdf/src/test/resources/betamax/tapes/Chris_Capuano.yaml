      '''Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; Frank Capuano''' (born August 19, 1978) is an American [[professional baseball]] [[pitcher]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. Capuano has also played for the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], [[Milwaukee Brewers]], [[New York Mets]], and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] of [[Major League Baseball]].

      ==Early life==
      Capuano graduated from St. Thomas School in West Springfield Massachusetts. Four years later, Capuano was the valedictorian of his class at [[Cathedral High School (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Cathedral High School]] in Springfield, Massachusetts and went on to earn a degree in [[Economics]] at [[Duke University]], where he earned membership in [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He was also a brother of the Xi Chapter of [[Alpha Tau Omega]] fraternity.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

      ==Professional career==
      ===Arizona Diamondbacks===
      Capuano was drafted by the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in the 8th round of the [[1999 Major League Baseball Draft|1999 amateur draft]] (238th overall). He played with [[South Bend Silver Hawks]] in 2000 and the [[El Paso Diablos]] in 2001. He began 2002 with the [[Tucson Sidewinders]] in AAA and was 4–1 with a 2.72 ERA when, on May 17, he had [[Tommy John surgery]] and missed the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2011/07/01/baseball-all-business-chris-capuano|title=Baseball is all business for Chris Capuano|author=Andrew Beaton|date=June 30, 2011|work=Duke Chronicle|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      He made his MLB debut with the Diamondbacks on May 4, 2003 against the [[Atlanta Braves]], picking up the loss in a two-inning appearance in extra innings. He made his first start on May 17 against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], but only lasted 4 and {{fraction|2|3}} innings while allowing seven earned runs to take the loss. He was optioned back to the minors after that start and called back up for a spot start on July 9 against the [[San Diego Padres]], where he worked seven innings, allowed only one unearned run and picked up his first victory. He returned to the minors after the appearance, where he made 23 starts for Tucson, with a 9–5 record and 3.34 ERA, earning him [[Pacific Coast League]] All-Star honors. He returned to the Diamondbacks when rosters expanded in September and overall appeared in 9 games for them, with 5 starts, and was 2–4 with a 4.64 ERA.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/capuach01.shtml|title=Chris Capuano Statistics and history|work=Baseball Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      ===Milwaukee Brewers===
      [[File:Cap.jpg|300px|thumb|Capuano pitching for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in {{Mlby|2006}}.]]
      On December 1, 2003, Capuano was traded to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] (along with [[Craig Counsell]], [[Lyle Overbay]], [[Junior Spivey]], [[Jorge De La Rosa]] and [[Chad Moeller]]) for [[Shane Nance]], [[Richie Sexson]] and minor leaguer Noochie Varner. He made 17 starts for the Brewers in 2004 and was 6–8 with a 4.99 ERA.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;/&gt;

      His 2005 season with the Brewers proved to be a break-out year as he posted 18 [[Win (baseball)|wins]], the highest total for a Brewer since [[Ted Higuera]] in [[1987 Milwaukee Brewers season|1987]]. He also led the [[National League]] in quality starts during the 2005 season. In 2006, Capuano continued his excellent pitching by taking over as the team's new [[Ace (baseball)|ace]] with [[Ben Sheets]] injured and was named to the [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] as a replacement for [[Tom Glavine]]. Capuano, however, ended up with only 11 wins in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;/&gt;

      Capuano started the 2007 season 5–0 and then the Milwaukee Brewers lost the next 22 games Capuano pitched in from May 12 to September 28. In June he hit his first major league home run against the [[Florida Marlins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;/&gt;

      Before the start of the 2008 season, he underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time in his career and missed the entire season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3394959|title=Reports: Brewers' Capuano headed for second Tommy John surgery|work=ESPN.com|date=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      The Brewers non-tendered Capuano following the 2008 season, making him a free agent but re-signed him to a minor league deal shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081212&amp;content_id=3715557&amp;vkey=news_mil&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mil Brewers do not tender offer to Capuano] - mlb.com&lt;/ref&gt; Before the start of the 2009 season Capuano had hoped to start live game pitching in mid May,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090220&amp;content_id=3856544&amp;vkey=news_mil&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mil Rehab road slow for Capuano] mlb.com&lt;/ref&gt; but was limited to a handful of games in the Brewers [[Rookie-level|rookie leagues]]. After becoming a free agent at the end of the season, Capuano was re-signed to a minor league contract with the Brewers on November 23, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20091123&amp;content_id=7708138&amp;vkey=news_mil&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mil &quot;Brewers sign Capuano, Halama&quot;] - mlb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      Capuano was invited to the Milwaukee Brewers' spring training for the 2010 season, but early on he complained of arm soreness and was placed in extended spring training. He would start the regular season with the Single A, [[Brevard County Manatees]] of the [[Florida State League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/sports/brewers/81043552.html &quot;Peterson has healthy outlook on building pitching staff&quot;] - ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel''&lt;/ref&gt; Capuano would only need 3 appearances with the Manatees before being promoted to the Triple A [[Nashville Sounds]]. In those 3 appearances, Capuano registered a 2–0 record with a 1.23 ERA and 17 strikeouts in 14{{fraction|2|3}} innings pitched. On May 28, 2010, Capuano made his final start for the Sounds, and was pulled after four innings. After the game, it was announced the Brewers had purchased his minor league contract and he was recalled to the majors.

      Capuano started the Brewers' June 3, 2010 game against the [[Florida Marlins]] in Miami, giving up three runs on seven hits in 3{{fraction|2|3}} innings while striking out four and walking one. He was charged with the loss in the 3–2 Marlins win. On July 3, 2010, he appeared in a Brewers victory against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in St. Louis. This snapped the streak of 26 straight losses he had appeared in between 2007 and 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;/&gt;

      ===New York Mets===
      [[File:Chris Capuano 2011.jpg|100px|thumb|Capuano pitching for the [[New York Mets]] in 2011.]]
      Capuano signed with the [[New York Mets]] before the 2011 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/news/story?id=5985802|title=New York Mets sign Chris Capuano, Taylor Buchholz; assign Igarashi|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2011-01-03|accessdate=2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 26, pitching against the [[Atlanta Braves]], he threw his first complete game shutout since 2005, setting a career high in strikeouts in a game with 13. He made 31 starts for the Mets in 2011, his most since 2006, and also appeared in relief twice. He was 11–12 with a 4.55 ERA during the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;/&gt;

      ===Los Angeles Dodgers===
      On December 2, 2011, Capuano signed a two-year deal worth $10 million with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. He started the 2012 season strong, with a 9–4 record and 2.91 in his first 18 starts but went only 3–8 with a 4.76 in his last 15 starts. Overall, he was 12–12 with a 3.72 in 33 starts.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;/&gt;

      Capuano began the 2013 season in the bullpen due to the Dodgers having too many starting pitchers. He got a chance to start on April 16 due to an injury to [[Zack Greinke]] but suffered his own injury, a strained left calf, in the game and only lasted three innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first=Andrew|date=2013-04-17|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130417&amp;content_id=45074436&amp;notebook_id=45074438&amp;vkey=notebook_la&amp;c_id=la|title=Dodgers place Capuano on DL, recall Federowicz|publisher=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wound up making 20 starts for the team in 2013, despite missing time with various injuries. He also appeared in 4 games out of the bullpen. His final record was 4–7 with a 4.26 ERA.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;/&gt;

      ===Boston Red Sox===
      On February 20, 2014, he reportedly agreed to a $2.25 million one year contract with the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Capuano passed his physical and the deal was made official on February 22, 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.providencejournal.com/sports/content/20140220-report-red-sox-sign-left-hander-chris-capuano.ece|title=Report: Red Sox sign left-hander Chris Capuano |work=Providence Journal|author=Tim Britton|date=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      Capuano played on [[United States national baseball team|Team USA]] in the {{By|2001}} [[World Cup of Baseball]] and helped the team earn a silver medal.

      ==Pitching style==
      Capuano is a finesse pitcher who relies on his deceptive delivery. He throws his [[fastball]] in the mid to upper 80s, and will sometimes hit 90&amp;nbsp;mph in the early stages of a game. Capuano also features a [[slider]] and a [[changeup]], and possesses an excellent [[pickoff]] move. In 2005 he led the major leagues in pickoffs with 12, though he also tied [[Brett Myers]] for [[balk]]s with 4.

      ==Personal==
      Capuano, along with teammates [[J. J. Hardy]], [[Bill Hall (infielder)|Bill Hall]], and [[Jeff Suppan]], appeared in an episode of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' on June 20, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2879463 &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;] - ESPN.com&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to Sarah Clifford,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helenair.com/sports/baseball/article_e9202804-984c-11de-b873-001cc4c002e0.html Return to the mound] - ''Helena Independent Record''&lt;/ref&gt; whom he met at Duke. She was a contender for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], for the [[modern pentathlon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmsrun.org/news/news_2003/pentathlon_1_12.shtml Sarah Clifford - Pentathlon Jan 2003] - Central Mass Striders&lt;/ref&gt;
