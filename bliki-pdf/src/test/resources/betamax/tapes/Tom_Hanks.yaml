      Hanks has earned and been nominated for numerous awards during his career, including winning a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Actor and an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' and a Golden Globe, an [[Academy Award]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and a People's Choice Award for Best Actor for his role in ''Forrest Gump'', and earning the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]s in 2004.

      Hanks is also known for his collaboration with film director [[Steven Spielberg]] on ''Saving Private Ryan'', ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', and ''[[The Terminal]],'' as well as the 2001 mini-series ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'', which launched Hanks also as a successful director, producer and writer. In 2010, Spielberg and Hanks were executive producers on the HBO mini-series [[The Pacific (TV miniseries)|''The Pacific'']] (a companion piece to ''Band of Brothers'').

      ==Early life==
      Hanks was born in [[Concord, California]]. His father, Amos Mefford Hanks (born in [[Glenn County, California]], on March 9, 1924&amp;nbsp;– died in [[Alameda, California]], on January 31, 1992), was an itinerant cook.&lt;ref name=tca&gt;Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Janet Marylyn (née Frager; born in [[Alameda County, California]], on January 18, 1932), was a hospital worker. Hanks' mother is of [[Portuguese-American|Portuguese]] ancestry (her family's surname was originally &quot;Fraga&quot;), while two of Hanks' paternal great-grandparents immigrated from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=QDXsSnjehrM|title=Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23373847-the-all-american-icons-with-british-roots.do |title=The all-American icons with British roots – Showbiz – Evening Standard |work=Thisislondon.co.uk |date=November 8, 2006 |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portuguesetimes.com/Ed_2070/util/beat.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Hanks' parents divorced in 1960. The family's three oldest children, Sandra (now Sandra Hanks Benoiton, a writer),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Female Nomad and Friends Interview: Sandra Hanks Benoiton|url=http://mexicoinsmallbytes.com/mexicoblog/?cat=10|accessdate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry (Lawrence M.

Hanks, Associate Professor]&amp;nbsp;– [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Tom, went with their father, while the youngest, [[Jim Hanks|Jim]], now an actor and filmmaker, remained with his mother in [[Red Bluff, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tom Hanks biography&quot;&gt;[http://www.biography.com/people/tom-hanks-9327661 Tom Hanks biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

      In addition to having a family history of Catholicism and [[Mormonism]], Hanks was a &quot;Bible-toting [[evangelical]] teenager&quot; for several years.&lt;ref name=mattingly&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/41996 |title=Mattingly: Tom Hanks talks about religion |author=Terry Mattingly |work=Scripps Howard News Service |date=March 25, 2009 |accessdate=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In school, Hanks was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later telling ''Rolling Stone'' magazine: &quot;I was a geek, a spaz. I was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I was the guy who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into trouble. I was always a real good kid and pretty responsible.&quot; In 1965, Amos Hanks married Frances Wong, a San Francisco native of [[Chinese American|Chinese descent]]. Frances had three children, two of whom lived with Tom during his high school years. Hanks acted in school plays, including ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', while attending [[Skyline High School (Oakland, California)|Skyline High School]] in [[Oakland, California]].

      Hanks studied theater at [[Chabot College]] in [[Hayward, California]], and after two years, transferred to [[California State University, Sacramento]].&lt;ref name=THanksCSUS-CalState&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calstate.edu/pa/clips2004/february/19feb/id.shtml|title=Show your ID: What do you call that university by the river?

I wouldn't take dates with me. I'd just drive to a theater, buy myself a ticket, sit in the seat and read the program, and then get into the play completely. I spent a lot of time like that, seeing [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], and all that.&quot;&lt;ref name=Blum1986&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blum |first=David |date=July 28, 1986 |title=Tom Hanks's Real Splash: A Funny Guy Grows Up in 'Nothing in Common' |journal=New York |publisher=New York Media |volume=19 |issue=29 |page=39 |issn=0028-7369 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9OYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      During his years studying theater, Hanks met [[Vincent Dowling]], head of the [[Great Lakes Theater Festival]] in [[Cleveland]], Ohio.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; At Dowling's suggestion, Hanks became an intern at the Festival. His internship stretched into a three-year experience that covered most aspects of theater production, including lighting, set design, and stage management, all of which caused Hanks to drop out of college. During the same time, Hanks won the Cleveland Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his 1978 performance as [[Proteus (The Two Gentlemen of Verona)|Proteus]] in Shakespeare's ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'', one of the few times he played a villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.clevelandmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=E73ABD6180B44874871A91F6BA5C249C&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=1578600D80804596A222593669321019&amp;tier=4&amp;id=516286375F5F4B71A3896EF13FF6915D |title=Life According to Tom Hanks |last=Mytnick |first=Colleen |work=[[Cleveland Magazine]] |date=October 2009 |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      ==Career==

      ===Early career===
      In 1979, Hanks moved to New York City, where he made his film debut in the low-budget [[slasher film]] ''[[He Knows You're Alone]]'' (1980)&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; and got a part in the television movie ''[[Mazes and Monsters]]''. Early in 1979, Hanks was cast in the lead role of Callimaco in the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]]'s production of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Mandrake]]'', directed by Daniel Southern. As a high profile [[Off Off Broadway]] [[Variety show|showcase]], the production helped Tom land an agent, Joe Ohla with the J. Michael Bloom Agency. The next year, Hanks landed a lead role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television pilot of ''[[Bosom Buddies]]'', playing the role of Kip Wilson. Hanks moved to Los Angeles, where he and [[Peter Scolari]] played a pair of young advertising men forced to dress as women so they could live in an inexpensive all-female hotel.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; Hanks had previously partnered with Scolari in the 1970s game show ''[[Make Me Laugh]]''. ''Bosom Buddies'' ran for two seasons, and, although the ratings were never strong, television critics gave the program high marks. &quot;The first day I saw him on the set,&quot; co-producer Ian Praiser told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', &quot;I thought, 'Too bad he won't be in television for long.' I knew he'd be a movie star in two years.&quot; But if Praiser knew it, he was not able to convince Hanks. &quot;The television show had come out of nowhere,&quot; best friend Tom Lizzio told ''Rolling Stone''. &quot;Then out of nowhere it got canceled. He figured he'd be back to pulling ropes and hanging lights in a theater.&quot;

      ''Bosom Buddies'' and a guest appearance on a 1982 episode of ''[[Happy Days]]'' (&quot;A Case of Revenge,&quot; where he played a disgruntled former classmate of [[Fonzie|The Fonz]]) prompted director [[Ron Howard]] to contact Hanks. Howard was working on ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' (1984), a romantic comedy fantasy about a [[mermaid]] who falls in love with a human. At first, Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, a role that eventually went to [[John Candy]]. Instead, Hanks got the lead role and a career boost from ''Splash'', which went on to become a box office hit, grossing more than US$69&amp;nbsp;million. He also had a sizable hit with the sex comedy ''[[Bachelor Party (1984 film)|Bachelor Party]]'', also in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tom Hanks biography&quot;/&gt;

      In 1983–84, Hanks made three guest appearances on ''[[Family Ties]]'' as Elyse Keaton's alcoholic brother, Ned Donnelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Television listings |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Uek4AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Tom+Hanks+Family+Ties&amp;dq=Tom+Hanks+Family+Ties |work=[[TV Guide (magazine)|TV Guide]] |date=November 27, 2003 |accessdate=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Riggs |first=Thomas |title=Contemporary Theatre, Film, and Television |publisher=[[Gale Research]] |year=2002 |page=117 |isbn=0-7876-5116-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      ===Period of successes and failures===
      [[File:TomHanks1989.png|thumb|right|upright|Hanks at Governor's Ball party after [[61st Academy Awards]], March 29, 1989]]

      With ''[[Nothing in Common]]'' (1986)&amp;nbsp;– about a young man alienated from his parents who must reestablish a relationship with his father, played by [[Jackie Gleason]]&amp;nbsp;– Hanks began to establish the credentials of not only a comic actor but of someone who could carry a serious role. &quot;It changed my desires about working in movies,&quot; Hanks told ''Rolling Stone''. &quot;Part of it was the nature of the material, what we were trying to say. But besides that, it focused on people's relationships. The story was about a guy and his father, unlike, say, ''[[The Money Pit]]'', where the story is really about a guy and his house.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of American Cinema|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zlSRS80XIfQC&amp;pg=PT1033&amp;lpg=PT1033&amp;dq=money+pit+Part+of+it+was+the+nature+of+the+material,+what+we+were+trying+to+say.+But+besides+that,+it+focused+on+people's+relationships.+The+story+was+about+a+guy+and+his+father,+unlike,+say,+The+Money+Pit,+where+the+story+is+really+about+a+guy+and+his+house&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iIBD7s1Rcf&amp;sig=L_9M7MEagWxsKMDunuyXcGfqehM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wY_7T-WRMoHr6wGZ6vGBBw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=money%20pit%20Part%20of%20it%20was%20the%20nature%20of%20the%20material%2C%20what%20we%20were%20trying%20to%20say.%20But%20besides%20that%2C%20it%20focused%20on%20people's%20relationships.%20The%20story%20was%20about%20a%20guy%20and%20his%20father%2C%20unlike%2C%20say%2C%20The%20Money%20Pit%2C%20where%20the%20story%20is%20really%20about%20a%20guy%20and%20his%20house&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      After a few more flops and a moderate success with ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', Hanks succeeded with the fantasy comedy ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'' (1988), both at the box office and within the industry.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; The film established Hanks as a major Hollywood talent. It was followed later that year by ''[[Punchline (film)|Punchline]]'', in which he and [[Sally Field]] co-starred as struggling comedians. Hanks's character, Steven Gold, a failing medical student trying to break into stand-up, was somewhat edgy and complex. Hanks' portrayal of Gold offered a glimpse of the far more dramatic roles Hanks would master in films to come. Hanks then suffered a pile of box-office failures: ''[[The 'Burbs]]'' (1989), ''[[Joe Versus the Volcano]]'' (1990), and ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities (film)|The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1990),&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; as a greedy [[Wall Street]] type who gets enmeshed in a hit-and-run accident. Only the 1989 movie ''[[Turner &amp; Hooch]]'' brought success for Hanks during this time. In a 1993 issue of ''[[Disney Adventures]]'', Hanks said, &quot;I saw ''Turner &amp; Hooch'' the other day in the SAC store and couldn't help but be reminiscent. I cried like a baby.&quot; He did admit to making a couple of &quot;bum tickers,&quot; however, and blamed his &quot;...deductive reasoning and decision making skills.&quot;

      ===Progression into dramatic roles===
      Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; Hanks has admitted that his acting in earlier roles was not great and that he has improved. In an interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Hanks noted his ''&quot;modern era of moviemaking ... because enough self-discovery has gone on.... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top&quot;''. This &quot;modern era&quot; began in 1993 for Hanks, first with ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' and then with ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''. The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the airwaves. Richard Schickel of ''TIME'' called his performance &quot;charming,&quot; and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=SCHICKEL|first=RICHARD|title=Modern Romance|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978809,00.html|work=Time magazine|date=July 5, 1993|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      In ''Philadelphia'', he played a [[homosexuality|gay]] lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; Hanks lost thirty-five pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'', Leah Rozen stated &quot;Above all, credit for ''Philadelphia'''s success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.&quot; Hanks won the 1993 [[Academy Award]] for Best Actor for his role in ''Philadelphia''.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; During his acceptance speech he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/oscars2000/story/0,,147619,00.html Winner Speeches].&lt;/ref&gt;

      Hanks followed ''Philadelphia'' with the 1994 hit ''[[Forrest Gump]]''. Of the film, Hanks has remarked: &quot;When I read the script for ''Gump'', I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.&quot; Hanks won his second Best Actor [[Academy Award]] for his role in ''Forrest Gump'', becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.&lt;ref name=&quot;67AcAwardsWins&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Grimes|first=William|title='Forrest Gump' Triumphs With 6 Academy Awards|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/28/movies/forrest-gump-triumphs-with-6-academy-awards.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 28, 1995|accessdate=October 20, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tdd3ad9J|archivedate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Spencer Tracy]] was the first, winning in 1937–38. Hanks and Tracy were the same age at the time they received their Academy Awards: 37 for the first and 38 for the second.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Teachout|first=Terry|title=The Eclipse of Spencer Tracy|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-eclipse-of-spencer-tracy/|work=commentarymagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      Hanks' next role—astronaut and commander [[Jim Lovell]], in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]''—reunited him with [[Ron Howard]].&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Bill Paxton]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Ed Harris]], and [[Kathleen Quinlan]]. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated blockbuster ''[[Toy Story]]'' as the voice of the toy [[Sheriff Woody]].

      ===1996–present: Directing, producing and acting===
      Hanks turned to directing with his 1996 film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]'' about a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer. Hanks and producer [[Gary Goetzman]] went on to create [[Playtone]], a record and film production company named for the record company in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=That Thing You Do! (1996)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/that_thing_you_do/|work=rottentomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      Hanks executive produced, co-wrote, and co-directed the [[HBO]] docudrama ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]''. The twelve-part series chronicles the space program from its inception, through the familiar flights of [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Jim Lovell]], to the personal feelings surrounding the reality of moon landings. The [[Emmy Award]]-winning project was, at US$68&amp;nbsp;million, one of the most expensive ventures taken for television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From the Earth to the Moon|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/from-the-earth-to-the-moon/|work=tv.com|accessdate= July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      Hanks' next project was no less expensive. For ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' he teamed up with [[Steven Spielberg]] to make a film about a search through war-torn France after [[D-Day]] to bring back a soldier. It earned the praise and respect of the film community, critics, and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saving Private Ryan (1998)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saving_private_ryan/|work=rottentomatoes|accessdate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was labeled one of the finest war films ever made and earned Spielberg his second [[Academy Award]] for direction, and Hanks another Best Actor nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=September 5, 2008|url=http://us.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/1999|title=Academy Awards, USA: 1999 |publisher=IMDB }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1998, Hanks re-teamed with his ''Sleepless in Seattle'' co-star [[Meg Ryan]] for ''[[You've Got Mail]]'', a remake of 1940's ''[[The Shop Around the Corner]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tom Hanks biography&quot;/&gt;

      In 1999, Hanks starred in an adaptation of the [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes | id=green_mile | title=The Green Mile }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also returned as the voice of Woody in ''[[Toy Story 2]].'' The following year he won a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Actor and an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of a marooned [[FedEx]] systems analyst in [[Robert Zemeckis]]'s ''[[Cast Away]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscars2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/73rd-winners.html |title=The 73rd Academy Awards (2001) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=July 10, 2012|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Hanks helped direct and produce the acclaimed HBO miniseries ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]''.
